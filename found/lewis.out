error
checking: In some cases, where retractions or additions seemed urgently needed, I have appended postscripts.
error
checking: Two other papers appear here for the first time.
12 syls
checking: The papers in this volume deal with topics concerning counterfactuals, causation, and related matters.
error
checking: Papers in ontology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language have appeared in Volume I. I have left out papers which are rejoinders, or which are of primarily technical interest, or which overlap too much with the papers I have included.
18 syls
checking: Abstracts of the omitted papers may be found here, in the bibliography of my writings.
20 syls
checking: Many of the papers, here and in Volume I, seem to me in hindsight to fall into place within a prolonged campaign on behalf of the thesis I call "Humean supervenience".
18 syls
checking: Explicit discussion of that thesis appears only in "A Subjectivist's Guide to Objective Chance"; but it motivates much of the book.
error
checking: Humean supervenience is named in honor of the greater denier of necessary connections.
error
checking: It is the doctrine that all there is to the world is a vast mosaic of local matters of particular fact, just one little thing and then another.
18 syls
checking: (But it is no part of the thesis that these local matters are mental.
18 syls
checking: ) We have geometry: a system of external relations of spatiotemporal end p.ix distance between points.
error
checking: Maybe points of spacetime itself, maybe point-sized bits of matter or aether or fields, maybe both.
error
checking: And at those points we have local qualities: perfectly natural intrinsic properties which need nothing bigger than a point at which to be instantiated.
20 syls
checking: 1 For short:  we have an arrangement of qualities.
error
checking: And that is all.
4 syls
checking: There is no difference without difference in the arrangement of qualities.
20 syls
checking: All else supervenes on that.
error
checking: First say it, then qualify it.
8 syls
checking: I don't really mean to say that no two possible worlds whatsoever differ in any way without differing in their arrangements of qualities.
19 syls
checking: For I condede that Humean supervenience is at best a contingent truth.
error
checking: Two worlds might indeed differ only in unHumean ways, if one or both of them is a world where Humean supervenience fails.
error
checking: Perhaps there might be extra, irreducible external relations, besides the spatiotemporal ones; there might be emergent natural properties of more-than-point-sized things; there might be things that endure identically through time or space, and trace out loci that cut across all lines of qualitative continuity.
error
checking: It is not, alas, unintelligible that there might be suchlike rubbish.
error
checking: Some worlds have it.
4 syls
checking: And when they do, it can make differences between worlds even if they match perfectly in their arrangements of qualities.
18 syls
checking: But if there is suchlike rubbish, say I, then there would have to be extra natural properties or relations that are altogether alien to this world.
error
checking: Within the inner sphere of possibility, from which these alien intrusions are absent, there is indeed no difference of worlds without a difference in their arrangements of qualities.
18 syls
checking: 2 Is this materialism?
error
checking: —no and yes.
3 syls
checking: I take it that materialism is metaphysics built to endorse the truth and descriptive completeness of physics more or less as we know it; and it just might be that Humean supervenience is true, but our best physics is dead wrong in its inventory of the qualities.
19 syls
checking: Maybe, but I doubt it.
6 syls
checking: Most likely, if Humean end p.x supervenience is true at all, it is true in more or less the way that present physics would suggest.
error
checking: I have conceded that Humean supervenience is a contingent, therefore an empirical, issue.
error
checking: Then why should I, as philosopher rather than physics fan, care about it?
18 syls
checking: Isn't my professional business more with the whole expanse of logical space than with the question which of its districts happens to be ours?
error
checking: —Fair enough.
3 syls
checking: Really, what I uphold is not so much the truth of Humean supervenience as the tenability of it.
error
checking: If physics itself were to teach me that it is false, I wouldn't grieve.
error
checking: That might happen: maybe the lesson of Bell's theorem is exactly that there are physical entities which are unlocalized, and which might therefore make a difference between worlds— worlds in the inner sphere—that match perfectly in their arrangements of local qualities.
18 syls
checking: Maybe so.
3 syls
checking: I'm ready to believe it.
8 syls
checking: But I am not ready to take lessons in ontology from quantum physics as it now is.
18 syls
checking: First I must see how it looks when it is purified of instrumentalist frivolity, and dares to say something not just about pointer readings but about the constitution of the world; and when it is purified of doublethinking deviant logic; and—most of all—when it is purified of supernatural tales about the power of the observant mind to make things jump.
19 syls
checking: If, after all that, it still teaches nonlocality, I shall submit willingly to the best of authority.
error
checking: What I want to fight are philosophical arguments against Humean supervenience.
error
checking: When philosophers claim that one or another commonplace feature of the world cannot supervene on the arrangement of qualities, I make it my business to resist.
18 syls
checking: Being a commonsensical fellow (except where unactualized possible worlds are concerned) I will seldom deny that the features in question exist.
error
checking: I grant their existence, and do my best to show how they can, after all, supervene on the arrangement of qualities.
18 syls
checking: The plan of battle is as follows.
9 syls
checking: First, laws of nature.
5 syls
checking: Few would deny that laws of nature, whatever else they may be, are at least exceptionless regularities.
18 syls
checking: Not all regularities are laws, of course.
error
checking: But, following the lead of (a short temporal segment of) Ramsey, I suggest that the laws are the ones that buy into those systems of truths that achieve an unexcelled combination of simplicity and strength.
18 syls
checking: That serves the Humean cause.
error
checking: For what it is to be simple and strong is safely noncontingent; and what regularities there are, or more generally what candidate systems of truths, seems to supervene safely on the arrangement of qualities.
error
checking: I stated such a theory of lawhood in my book Counterfactuals,3 and here I discuss it further  end p.xi in Postscript C to "A Subjectivist's Guide to Objective Chance".
error
checking: I am prepared at this point to take the offensive against alleged unHumean lawmakers; I say there is no point believing in them, because they would be unfit for their work.
error
checking: Here I have in mind the theory that laws are made by a lawmaking second-order relation of universals, a theory most fully presented by D. M. Armstrong in What is a Law of Nature?
19 syls
checking: 4 Let N be the supposed lawmaker relation; the idea, in its simplest form, is that it is a contingent matter, and one not supervenient on the arrangement of qualities, which universals stand in the relation N; but it is somehow necessary that if N(F, G), then we have the regularity that all F's are G's.
error
checking: I ask: how can the alleged lawmaker impose a regularity?
18 syls
checking: Why can't we have N(F, G), and still have F's that are not G's?
18 syls
checking: What prevents it?
4 syls
checking: Don't try defining N in terms of there being a law and hence a regularity—we're trying to explain lawhood.
18 syls
checking: And it's no good just giving the lawmaker a name that presupposes that somehow it does its stuff, as when Armstrong calls it "necessitation".
19 syls
checking: If you find it hard to ask why there can't be F's that are not G's when F "necessitates" G, you should ask instead how any N can do what it must do to deserve that name.
18 syls
checking: Next, counterfactuals.
error
checking: I take them to be governed by similarity of worlds, according to the analysis given in "Counterfactuals and Comparative Possibility," in this volume.
18 syls
checking: To the extent that this similarity consists of perfect match in matters of particular fact, it supervenes easily on the arrangement of qualities; and to the extent that it consists of (perfect or imperfect) conformity by one world to the laws of the other, it supervenes if the laws do.
18 syls
checking: In "Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow," I argue that one important sort of counterfactual, at least, will work properly if it is governed by just these respects of similarity.
error
checking: Next, causation.
4 syls
checking: In "Causation" and its postscripts, I defend an analysis of causation in terms of counterfactual dependence between events.
20 syls
checking: The counterfactuals are discussed here in the two papers just mentioned; and since counterfactual dependence only seems causal when it is between events, my treatment of causation requires "Events" before it is done.
error
checking: Causation draws the arrow from past to future; that arrow exists only as an asymmetric pattern in the arrangement of qualities, so causal counterfactuals must somehow be sensitive end p.xii to the asymmetry.
19 syls
checking: In "Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow" I offer an account of that sensitivity.
error
checking: Given causation, or rather causal dependence, we can proceed to causal analyses of various things; for instance seeing, in "Veridical Hallucination and Prosthetic Vision," or what else you can do if you can freely raise your hand, in "Are We Free To Break the Laws"?
18 syls
checking: Next, persistence through time.
6 syls
checking: I take the view that nothing endures identically through time.
error
checking: (Except universals, if such there be; their loci would coincide with relations of qualitative match, would indeed constitute these relations, so they would commit no violations of Humean supervenience.
error
checking: ) Persisting particulars consist of temporal parts, united by various kinds of continuity.
18 syls
checking: To the extent that the continuity is spatiotemporal and qualitative, of course it supervenes on the arrangement of qualities.
error
checking: But the continuity that often matters most is causal continuity: the thing stays more or less the same because of the way its later temporal parts depend causally for their existence and character on the ones just before.
21 syls
checking: So the spatiotemporal boundaries of persisting things, for instance people, can supervene on the arrangement of qualities, provided that causation does.
error
checking: I discuss lines of causal continuity, not ruling out zigzag or broken lines, in "The Paradoxes of Time Travel".
18 syls
checking: In "Survival and Identity," in Volume I of these Papers, I reply to some paradoxes brought against the idea that our survival is a matter of continuities that unite our temporal parts.
18 syls
checking: 5 Next, mind and language.
error
checking: Several papers in the previous volume concern the thesis that mental states, indexed with content when appropriate, are definable as the occupants of causal roles.
19 syls
checking: Some of these states are people's beliefs, and some of their beliefs are their end p.xiii  expectations about other people.
18 syls
checking: In Convention,6 and in "Languages and Language" and "Radical Interpretation" in Volume I, I suggested how semantic facts could obtain in virtue of the mutual expectations that prevail in a linguistic community.
error
checking: And so it goes.
4 syls
checking: There is room for endless argument over the details, but I remain confident that at every step mentioned the connection is something like what I have said—enough like it, anyway, to allow the cumulative Humean supervenience of one thing after another.
18 syls
checking: At every step mentioned—but there is one that I passed over.
16 syls
checking: There is one big bad bug: chance.
7 syls
checking: It is here, and here alone, that I fear defeat.
12 syls
checking: But if I'm beaten here, then the entire campaign goes kaput.
error
checking: For chances enter at the very beginning.
12 syls
checking: A law, I said with Ramsey, is a regularity that enters into the best systems.
19 syls
checking: But what sort of systems?
6 syls
checking: If there are chances—single-case objective probabilities, for instance, that a certain atom will decay this week—then some regularities have to do with chances, and the best true systems will be those that do best, inter alia, at systematizing the truth about chances.
19 syls
checking: So bestness of true systems, and hence lawhood, and hence counterfactuals and causation and occupancy of causal roles and all the rest, will not supervene just on the actual arrangement of qualities, but on that plus all the chances there are, at various times, of that arrangement continuing in one way or another.
error
checking: Therefore the only hope for Humean supervenience is that the chances themselves might somehow supervene on the arrangement of qualities.
error
checking: How could they?
3 syls
checking: It is easy to go partway.
error
checking: The chances for alternative futures that obtain at a moment surely depend on just how things actually are at that moment.
19 syls
checking: We might as well throw in the way things are at all previous times; that might help, and it's no harm including too much.
18 syls
checking: So far, so good.
4 syls
checking: We have a conditional: if history is so-and-so then the chances are such-and-such.
19 syls
checking: And the antecedent of that conditional—history up to the moment in question—surely does supervene on the arrangement of qualities.
18 syls
checking: But what is the status of the history-to-chance conditional itself?
19 syls
checking: Is it necessary or contingent?
10 syls
added:  How could they? So far, so good. Is it necessary or contingent?
checking: If contingent, does it supervene or not on the arrangement of qualities?
error
checking: If history-to-chance conditionals are necessary truths, no worries.
error
checking: Then the chances at any moment supervene on the arrangement of qualities, in fact on just the part of it up to that moment.
error
checking: Sometimes, we can see how the conditional might be necessary: suppose it says end p.xiv that when we have prominent symmetry in the present set-up and its alternative futures, then those futures have equal chances.
19 syls
checking: But sometimes not.
4 syls
checking: How can an equality of chances based on symmetries, or any such necessary principle, give us the connections we need between, say, the exact height of a potential barrier and the exact chance of tunnelling through it?
error
checking: I hope there is a way, given the trouble I'm in if not; but I can't see what it is.
18 syls
checking: If the conditionals are contingent, but themselves supervene on the arrangement of qualities, then again no worries.
error
checking: That would be so if they hold in virtue of relevant actual frequencies throughout the world, for instance.
20 syls
checking: Or they could supervene in some fancier way, for instance by means of the "package deal" for chances and laws that I consider in Postscript C to "A Subjectivist's Guide to Objective Chance".
error
checking: Alas, I fear it cannot be so.
9 syls
checking: The trouble is that whatever pattern it is in the arrangement of qualities that makes the conditionals true will itself be something that has some chance of coming about, and some chance of not coming about.
18 syls
checking: What happens if there is some chance of getting a pattern that would undermine that very chance?
19 syls
checking: The Principal Principle of "A Subjectivist's Guide to Objective Chance" affords a way of turning this vague worry into a proper argument; hence the dismal ending to that paper.
error
checking: Why not give in?
4 syls
added:  But sometimes not. Alas, I fear it cannot be so. Why not give in?
checking: I could admit that the history-to-chance conditionals, and so the chances themselves, are contingent and do not supervene on the arrangement of qualities.
error
checking: I could insist for consolation that at any rate all else supervenes on the arrangement of qualities and the chances together.
error
checking: Why not?
2 syls
checking: I am not moved just by loyalty to my previous opinions.
17 syls
added: I am not moved just by loyalty to my previous opinions.
checking: That answer works no better than the others.
11 syls
checking: Here again the unHumean candidate for the job turns out to be unfit for its work.
error
checking: The distinctive thing about chances is their place in the 'Principal Principle,' which compellingly demands that we conform our credences about outcomes to our credences about their  chances.
20 syls
checking: Roughly, he who is certain the coin is fair must give equal credence to heads and tails; being less rough is the main business of "A Subjectivist's Guide to Objective Chance".
18 syls
checking: I can see, dimly, how it might be rational to conform my credences about outcomes to my credences about history, symmetries, and frequencies.
error
checking: I haven't the faintest notion how it might be rational to conform my credences about outcomes to my credences about some mysterious unHumean magnitude.
19 syls
checking: Don't try to take the mystery away by saying that this unHumean magnitude is none other than chance!
error
checking: I say that I haven't the faintest notion how an unHumean magnitude can possibly do what it must do end p.xv to deserve that name—namely, fit into the principle about rationality of credences—so don't just stipulate that it bears that name.
error
checking: Don't say: here's chance, now is it Humean or not?
error
checking: Ask: is there any way that any Humean magnitude could fill the chance-role?
error
checking: Is there any way that an unHumean magnitude could?
error
checking: What I fear is that the answer is "no" both times!
12 syls
checking: Yet how can I reject the very idea of chance, when I know full well that each tritium atom has a certain chance of decaying at any moment?
18 syls
checking: 7 I thank all those who have helped me to think about these matters.
error
checking: Those who have helped me most are listed in the footnotes to the papers and the postscripts.
18 syls
checking: Also I thank the University of California at Los Angeles; Princeton University; St. Catherine's College, Oxford; the American Council of Learned Societies; The University of Adelaide and the Australian-American Education Foundation; the National Science Foundation; Victoria University of Wellington and the New Zealand-United States Educational Foundation; Monash University; The Australian National University; La Trobe University; and all those universities that have given me opportunities to try these papers out on critical audiences.
20 syls
checking: For advice and assistance in planning these two volumes, and in seeing the project through difficult times, I am most grateful to Jim Anderson, Jonathan Bennett, Adam Hodgkin, Ruth Marcus, Tom Nagel, and Robert Stalnaker.
18 syls
checking: I thank Nancy Etchemendy for the diagrams in Postscript E to "Causation".

error
checking: Are they noncontingent?
error
checking: If so, T is necessary, since ex hypothesi it is at least possible.
error
checking: Then H by itself strictly implies F. How can that be?
14 syls
checking: What prevents us having H without F, when they specify the character of wholly distinct parts of the world?
19 syls
checking: This necessary connection between distinct existences is unintelligible.
error
checking: 2.
error
checking: Are they contingent, but supervenient on the arrangement of qualities?
error
checking: Then what would make T true is some pattern in the arrangement of qualities, and it is open to say that part of that pattern is simply that H does not hold or that F does.
19 syls
checking: If so, we know how H and T can strictly imply F, so this second hypothesis gives no special problem about the case of extreme chances.
18 syls
checking: But it still has its general problem: apart from the extreme case, how can a chancemaking pattern not give itself some chance of failing to obtain?
18 syls
checking: 3.
error
checking: Are they contingent, and not supervenient upon the arrangement of qualities?
error
checking: Then if T is true, there is some unHumean feature of the world that makes it true.
error
checking: Call this unHumean chancemaker X. Now X and H strictly imply F. How can that be?
error
checking: How could X manage to impose this constraint on the arrangement of qualities?
20 syls
checking: If we reject strict implication of F by H alone, as we should, then we grant that there are arrangements of qualities which make H hold without F. How does X prevent us from having any of these arrangements?
18 syls
checking: Compare this unHumean chancemaker with Armstrong's unHumean lawmaker, denounced above.
error
checking: Armstrong has a fair tu quoque against anyone who accepts the one and balks at the other.
error
checking: For the two are alike in their supposed power to constrain the course of events, except that one imposes a connection in the single case and the other imposes a general regularity.
18 syls
checking: (Indeed, the chancemaker might just be the lawmaker  at work in one particular instance.
error
checking: ) Either way, it's unintelligible how the unHumean constrainer can possibly do its stuff.
error
checking: None of these three alternatives seems at all good.
12 syls
checking: The escape routes from the trilemma—doubting that chances really can take the extreme values, doubting that every genuine possibility deserves some slight credence, or doubting the Principal Principle— seem just as bad.
error
checking: But so far as I can see, we must choose one evil or another.
17 syls
added: But so far as I can see, we must choose one evil or another.
checking: end p.xvii Part Four Counterfactuals and Time end p.1 end p.2 Sixteen Counterfactuals and Comparative Possibility In the last dozen years or so, our understanding of modality has been much improved by means of possible-world semantics: the project of analyzing modal language by systematically specifying the conditions under which a modal sentence is true at a possible world.
error
checking: I hope to do the same for counterfactual conditionals.
error
checking: I write A → C for the counterfactual conditional with antecedent A and consequent C. It may be read as "If it were the case that A, then it would be the case that C" or some more idiomatic paraphrase thereof.
error
checking: 1.
error
checking: Analyses I shall lead up by steps to an analysis I believe to be satisfactory.
19 syls
checking: ANALYSIS 0.
error
checking: A → C is true at world i iff C holds at every A-world such that—.
error
checking: "Aworld", of course, means "world where A holds".
error
checking: The blank is to be filled in with some sort of condition restricting the end p.3 A-worlds to be considered.
18 syls
checking: The condition may depend on i but not on A. For instance, we might consider only those A-worlds that agree with i in certain specified respects.
18 syls
checking: On this analysis, the counterfactual is some fixed strict conditional.
error
checking: No matter what condition we put into the blank, Analysis 0 cannot be correct.
error
checking: For it says that if A → B is true at i, B holds at every A-world such that—.
18 syls
checking: In other words, there are no ABworlds such that—.
error
checking: Then AB → C and AB → C are alike vacuously true, and − (AB → C) and − (AB → C ) are alike false, for any C whatever.
error
checking: On the contrary: it can perfectly well happen that A → B is true, yet AB → C is non-vacuous, and AB → C is false.
18 syls
checking: In fact, we can have an arbitrarily long sequence like this of non-vacuously true counterfactuals and true denials of their opposites: A □→ B¯ and – (A□→B), AB □→ C¯ and – (AB □→ C), ABC □→ D¯ and – (ABC □→D), Etc.
18 syls
checking: Example: if Albert had come to the party, he would not have brought Betty; for, as he knows, if he had come and had brought Betty, Carl would not have stayed; for, as Carl knows, if Albert had come and had brought Betty and Carl had stayed, Daisy would not have danced with him; .

error
checking: On the contrary: we can have an arbitrarily long sequence like this of non-vacuously true counterfactuals and true denials of their opposites: A □→ Z¯ and – (A□→Z), AB□→Z¯ and – (AB □→Z), ABC□→Z¯ and – (ABC□→Z),  Etc.

checking: More precisely, it is not any one, fixed strict conditional.
16 syls
checking: But this much of Analysis 0 is correct: (1) to assess the truth of a counterfactual end p.4 we must consider whether the consequent holds at certain antecedent-worlds; (2) we should not consider all antecedent-worlds, but only some of them.
error
checking: We may ignore antecedent-worlds that are gratuitously remote from actuality.
18 syls
checking: Rather than any fixed strict conditional, we need a variably strict conditional.
18 syls
checking: Given a farfetched antecedent, we look perforce at antecedent-worlds remote from actuality.
18 syls
checking: There are no others to look at.
8 syls

error
checking: It may happen that we can find an A-world that meets some stringent restriction; before we can find any AB-world we must relax the restriction; before we can find any ABC-world we must relax it still more; and so on.
19 syls
checking: If so a counterexample sequence of the first kind definitely will appear, and one of the second kind will appear also if there is a suitable Z. We dream of considering a world where the antecedent holds but everything else is just as it actually is, the truth of the antecedent being the one difference between that world and ours.

checking: No hope.

checking: Hold everything else fixed after making one change, and you will not have a possible world at all.
18 syls
checking: If we cannot have an antecedent-world that is otherwise just like our world, what can we have?
18 syls
checking: This, perhaps: an antecedent-world that does not differ gratuitously from ours; one that differs only as much as it must to permit the antecedent to hold; one that is closer to our world in similarity, all things considered, than any other antecedent-world.

checking: A → C is true at i iff C holds at the closest (accessible) A-world to i, if there is one.
error
checking: This is Stalnaker's proposal in "A Theory of Conditionals", and elsewhere.
error
checking: end p.5 It may be objected that Analysis 1 is founded on comparative similarity—"closeness"—of worlds, and that comparative similarity is hopelessly imprecise unless some definite respect of comparison has been specified.
error
checking: Imprecise it may be; but that is all to the good.
13 syls
checking: Counterfactuals are imprecise too.
error
checking: Two imprecise concepts may be rigidly fastened to one another, swaying together rather than separately, and we can hope to be precise about their connection.
18 syls
checking: Imprecise though comparative similarity may be, we do judge the comparative similarity of complicated things like cities or people or philosophies—and we do it often without benefit of any definite respect of comparison stated in advance.
18 syls
checking: We balance off various similarities and dissimilarities according to the importances we attach to various respects of comparison and according to the degrees of similarity in the various respects.
error
checking: Conversational context, of course, greatly affects our weighting of respects of comparison, and even in a fixed context we have plenty of latitude.
18 syls
checking: Still, not anything goes.
6 syls
checking: We have concordant mutual expectations, mutual expectations of expectations, etc.
error
checking: , about the relative importances we will attach to respects of comparison.
error
checking: Often these are definite and accurate  and firm enough to resolve the imprecision of comparative similarity to the point where we can converse without misunderstanding.
18 syls
checking: Such imprecision we can live with.
error
checking: Still, I grant that a counterfactual based on comparative similarity has no place in the language of the exact sciences.
error
checking: I imposed a restriction to A-worlds "accessible" from i. In this I follow Stalnaker, who in turn is following the common practice in modal logic.
18 syls
checking: We might think that there are some worlds so very remote from i that they should always be ignored (at i) even if some of them happen to be Aworlds and there are no closer A-worlds.
18 syls
checking: If so, we have the wherewithal to ignore them by deeming them inaccessible from i. I can think of no very convincing cases, but I prefer to remain neutral on the point.
error
checking: If we have no need for accessibility restrictions, we can easily drop them by stipulating that all worlds are mutually interaccessible.
20 syls
checking: Unfortunately, Analysis 1 depends on a thoroughly implausible assumption: that there will never be more than one closest A-world.
error
checking: So fine are the gradations of comparative similarity that despite the infinite number and variety of worlds every tie is broken.
18 syls
checking: Example: A is "Bizet and Verdi are compatriots", F is "Bizet and Verdi are French", I is "Bizet and Verdi are Italian".
19 syls
checking: Grant for the sake of argument that we have the closest F-world and the closest I-world; that these are distinct (dual citizenships would be a gratuitous difference from actuality); and that these are the two finalists in the end p.6 competition for closest A-world.
18 syls
checking: It might be that something favors one over the other—for all I know, Verdi narrowly escaped settling in France and Bizet did not narrowly escape settling in Italy.
18 syls
checking: But we can count on no such luck.
8 syls
checking: The case may be perfectly balanced between respects of comparison that favor the F-world and respects that favor the I-world.
18 syls
checking: It is out of the question, on Analysis 1, to leave the tie unbroken.
error
checking: That means there is no such thing as the closest A-world.
13 syls
checking: Then anything you like holds at the closest A-world if there is one, because there isn't one.
19 syls
checking: If Bizet and Verdi had been compatriots they would have been Ukranian.
error
checking: ANALYSIS 2.
error
checking: A → C is true at i iff C holds at every closest (accessible) A-world to i, if there are any.
error
checking: This is the obvious revision of Stalnaker's analysis to permit a tie in comparative similarity between several equally close closest A-worlds.
18 syls
checking: Under Analysis 2 unbreakable ties are no problem.
error
checking: The case of Bizet and Verdi comes out as follows.
13 syls
checking: A → F, A → F , A → I, and A → I are all false.
12 syls
checking: A → (F V I) and A → ( F V I ) are both true.
12 syls
checking: A → FI and A → F I are both false.
9 syls
checking: These conclusions seem reasonable enough.
11 syls
checking: This reasonable settlement, however, does not sound so good in words.
18 syls
checking: A → F and A → F are both false, so we want to assert their negations.
error
checking: But negate their English readings in any straightforward and natural way, and we do not get − (A → F) and − (A → F ) as desired.
18 syls
checking: Rather the negation moves in and attaches only to the consequent, and we get sentences that seem to mean A → F and A → F- - a pair of falsehoods, together implying the further falsehood that Bizet and Verdi could not have been compatriots; and exactly the opposite of what we meant to say.
19 syls
checking: Why is it so hard to negate a whole counterfactual, as opposed to negating the consequent?
error
checking: The defender of Analysis 1 is ready with an explanation.
error
checking: Except when A is impossible, he says, there is a unique closest A-world.
18 syls
checking: Either C is false there, making − (A → C) and A → C alike true, or C is true there, making them alike false.
18 syls
checking: Either way, the two agree.
7 syls
checking: We have no need of a way to say − (A → C) because we might as well say A → C instead (except when A is impossible, in which case we have no need of a way to say − (A → C) because it is false).
18 syls
checking: There is some appeal to the view that − (A → C) and A → C are equivalent (except when A is impossible) and we might be tempted thereby to return to Analysis 1.
19 syls
checking: We might do better to return only part end p.7 way, using Bas van Fraassen's method of supervaluations to construct a compromise between Analyses 1 and 2.
error
checking: ANALYSIS 1½.
error
checking: A□→C is true at i iff C holds at a certain arbitrarily chosen one of the closest (accessible) A-worlds to i, if there are any.
error
checking: A sentence is super-true iff it is true no matter how the arbitrary choices are made, super-false iff false no matter how the arbitrary choices are  made.
error
checking: Otherwise it has no super-truth value.
11 syls
checking: Unless a particular arbitrary choice is under discussion, we abbreviate "super-true" as "true", and so on.
18 syls
checking: Something of this kind is mentioned at the end of Thomason, "A Fitch-Style Formulation of Conditional Logic".
18 syls
checking: Analysis 1½ agrees with Analysis 1 about the equivalence (except when A is impossible) of − (A → C) and A → C .
error
checking: If there are accessible A-worlds, the two agree in truth (i.e. super-truth) value, and further their biconditional is (super-)true.
19 syls
checking: On the other hand, Analysis 1½ tolerates ties in comparative similarity as happily as Analysis 2.
error
checking: Indeed a counterfactual is (super-)true under Analysis 1½ iff it is true under Analysis 2.
error
checking: On the other hand, a counterfactual false under Analysis 2 may either be false or have no (super-)truth value under Analysis 1½ .
error
checking: The case of Bizet and Verdi comes out as follows: A → F, A → I, A → F , A → I , and their negations have no truth value.
18 syls
checking: A → (F V I) and A → ( F V I ) are (super-)true.
13 syls
checking: A → FI and A → FI are (super)false.
9 syls
checking: This seems good enough.
5 syls
checking: For all I have said yet, Analysis 1½ solves the problem of ties as well as Analysis 2, provided we're not too averse to (super-)truth value gaps.
error
checking: But now look again at the question how to deny a counterfactual.
error
checking: We have a way after all: to deny a "would" counterfactual, use a "might" counterfactual with the same antecedent and negated consequent.
error
checking: In reverse likewise: to deny a "might" counterfactual, use a "would" counterfactual with the same antecedent and negated consequent.
error
checking: Writing A → C for "If it were the case that A, then it might be the case that C" or some more idiomatic paraphrase, we have these valid-sounding equivalences: (1) − (A → C) is equivalent to A ◊→ C , (2) − (A ◊→ C) is equivalent to A → C .
18 syls
checking: The two equivalences yield an explicit definition of "might" from "would" counterfactuals: A◊→C =df – (A□→C¯); or, if we prefer, the dual definition of "would" from "might".
error
checking: According end p.8 to this definition and Analysis 2, A → C is true at i iff C holds at some closest (accessible) A-world to i. In the case of Bizet and Verdi, A → F, A → F , A → I, A → I are all true; so are A → (F V I) and A → ( F V I ); but A → FI and A → FI are false.
error
checking: According to the definition and Analysis 1 or 1½, on the other hand, A → C and A → C are equivalent except when A is impossible.
error
checking: That should put the defender of those analyses in an uncomfortable spot.
20 syls
checking: He cannot very well claim that "would" and "might" counterfactuals do not differ except when the antecedent is impossible.
error
checking: He must therefore reject my definition of the "might" counterfactual; and with it, the equivalences (1) and (2), uncontroversial though they sound.
error
checking: He then owes us some other account of the "might" counterfactual, which I do not think he can easily find.
error
checking: Finally, once we see that we do have a way to negate a whole counterfactual, we no longer appreciate his explanation of why we don't need one.
error
checking: I conclude that he would be better off moving at least to Analysis 2.
19 syls
checking: Unfortunately, Analysis 2 is not yet satisfactory.
error
checking: Like Analysis 1, it depends on an implausible assumption.
error
checking: Given that some A-world is accessible from i, we no longer assume that there must be exactly one closest A-world to i; but we still assume that there must be at least one.
19 syls
checking: I call this the Limit Assumption.
9 syls
checking: It is the assumption that as we proceed to closer and closer A-worlds we eventually hit a limit and can go no farther.
18 syls
checking: But why couldn't it happen that there are closer and closer A-worlds without end—for each one, another even closer to i?
error
checking: Example: A is "I am over 7 feet tall".
error
checking: If there are closest A-worlds to ours, pick one of them: how tall am I there?
18 syls
checking: I must be 7 + ε feet tall, for some positive ε, else it would not be an A-world.
error
checking: But there are A-worlds where I am only 7 + ε/2 feet tall.
error
checking: Since that is closer to my actual height, why isn't one of these worlds closer to ours than the purportedly closest A-world where I am 7 + ε feet tall?
error
checking: And why isn't a suitable world where I am only 7 + ε/4 feet even closer to ours, and so ad infinitum?
error
checking: (In special cases, but not in general, there may be a good reason why not.
18 syls
checking: Perhaps 7 + ε could have been produced by a difference in one gene, whereas any height below that but still above 7 would have taken differences in many genes.
error
checking: ) If there are A-worlds closer and closer to i without end, then any  consequent you like holds at every closest A-world to i, because there aren't any.
18 syls
checking: If I were over 7 feet tall I would bump my head on the sky.
error
checking: end p.9 ANALYSIS 3.
error
checking: A → C is true at i iff some (accessible) AC-world is closer to i than any A C -world, if there are any (accessible) A-worlds.
error
checking: This is my final analysis.
9 syls
checking: Analysis 3 looks different from Analysis 1 or 2, but it is similar in principle.
error
checking: Whenever there are closest (accessible) A-worlds to a given world, Analyses 2 and 3 agree on the truth value there of A → C. They agree also, of course, when there are no (accessible) A-worlds.
18 syls
checking: When there are closer and closer A-worlds without end, A → C is true iff, as we proceed to closer and closer A-worlds, we eventually leave all the A C -worlds behind and find only AC-worlds.
error
checking: Using the definition of A → C as - (A → C ), we have this derived truth condition for the "might" counterfactual: A → C is true at i iff for every (accessible) A C -world there is some AC-world at least as close to i, and there are (accessible) A-worlds.
18 syls
checking: We have discarded two assumptions about comparative similarity in going from Analysis 1 to Analysis 3: first Stalnaker's assumption of uniqueness, then the Limit Assumption.
20 syls
checking: What assumptions remain?
6 syls
checking: First the Ordering Assumption: that for each world i, comparative similarity to i yields a weak ordering of the worlds accessible from i. That is, writing j≤ i k to mean that k is not closer to i than j, each ≤ i is connected and transitive.
22 syls
checking: Whenever j and k are accessible from i either j≤ i k or k≤ i j; whenever h≤ i j and j≤ i k, then h≤ i k. It is convenient, if somewhat artificial, to extend the comparative similarity orderings to encompass also the inaccessible worlds, if any: we stipulate that each ≤ i is to be a weak ordering of all the worlds, and that j is closer to i than k whenever j is accessible from i and k is not.
18 syls
checking: (Equivalently: whenever j≤ i k, then if k is accessible from i so is j.) Second, the Centering Assumption: that each world i is accessible from itself, and closer to itself than any other world is to it.
error
checking: 2.
error
checking: Reformulations Analysis 3 can be given several superficially different, but equivalent, reformulations.
error
checking: 2.
error
checking: 1 Comparative Possibility Introduce a connective ≺.
error
checking: A ≺ B is read as "It is less remote from actuality that A than that B" or "It is more possible that A than that B" and is true at a world i iff some (accessible) A-world is closer to i than end p.10 is any B-world.
18 syls
checking: First a pair of modalities and then the counterfactual can be defined from this new connective of comparative possibility, as follows.
error
checking: (Let ⊥ be a sentential constant false at every world, or an arbitrarily chosen contradiction; later, let ⊤ =  df  – ⊥.
error
checking: )  ◊A = A ≺ ⊥; □A = - ◊ - A; A□→C = ◊A ⊃ (AC ≺ AC¯).
11 syls
checking: The modalities so defined are interpreted by means of accessibility in the usual way.
22 syls
checking: A is true at i iff some A-world is accessible from i, and A is true at i iff A holds throughout all the worlds accessible from i. If accessibility restrictions are discarded, so that all worlds are mutually interaccessible, they become the ordinary "logical" modalities.
error
checking: (We might rather have defined the two modalities and comparative possibility from the counterfactual.
18 syls
checking: df  df  df  □A = df A¯ □→ ⊥; ◊A = df –□ – A; A ≺ B = df ◊A & ((A v B) □→ AB¯).
error
checking: Either order of definitions is correct according to the given truth conditions.
19 syls
checking: ) Not only is comparative possibility technically convenient as a primitive; it is of philosophical interest for its own sake.
20 syls
checking: It sometimes seems true to say: It is possible that A but not that B, it is possible that B but not that C, C but not D, etc.
18 syls
checking: Example: A is "I speak English", B is "I speak German" (a language I know), C is "I speak Finnish", D is "A dog speaks Finnish", E is "A stone speaks Finnish", F is "A number speaks Finnish".
18 syls
checking: Perhaps if I say all these things, as I would  like to, I am equivocating—shifting to weaker and weaker noncomparative senses of "possible" from clause to clause.
20 syls
checking: It is by no means clear that there are enough distinct senses to go around.
19 syls
checking: As an alternative hypothesis, perhaps the clauses are compatible comparisons of possibility without equivocation: A < B < C < D < E < F. (Here and elsewhere, I compress conjunctions in the obvious way.
20 syls
checking: ) 2.
error
checking: 2 Cotenability Call B cotenable at i with the supposition that A iff some A-world accessible from i is closer to i than any B -world, or if there are no A-worlds accessible from i. In other words: iff, at i, the supposition that A is either more possible than the falsity of B, or else impossible.
error
checking: Then A → C is true at i iff C follows from A together with auxiliary end p.11 premises B 1 , .
error
checking: .
0 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: , each true at i and cotenable at i with the supposition that A. There is less to this definition than meets the eye.
error
checking: A conjunction is cotenable with a supposition iff its conjuncts all are; so we need only consider the case of a single auxiliary premise B. That single premise may always be taken either as A (if A is impossible) or as A ⊃ C (otherwise); so "follows" may be glossed as "follows by truth-functional logic".
error
checking: Common opinion has it that laws of nature are cotenable with any supposition unless they are downright inconsistent with it.
error
checking: What can we make of this?
6 syls
checking: Whatever else laws may be, they are generalizations that we deem especially important.
18 syls
checking: If so, then conformity to the prevailing laws of a world i should weigh heavily in the similarity of other worlds to i. Laws should therefore tend to be cotenable, unless inconsistent, with counterfactual suppositions.
18 syls
checking: Yet I think this tendency may be overridden when conformity to laws carries too high a cost in differences of particular fact.
18 syls
checking: Suppose, for instance, that i is a world governed (in all respects of the slightest interest to us) by deterministic laws.
18 syls
checking: Let A pertain to matters of particular fact at time t; let A be false at i, and determined at all previous times to be false.
18 syls
checking: There are some A-worlds where the laws of i are never violated; all of these differ from i in matters of particular fact at all times before t. (Nor can we count on the difference approaching zero as we go back in time.
18 syls
checking: ) There are other A-worlds exactly like i until very shortly before t when a small, local, temporary, imperceptible suspension of the laws permits A to come true.
19 syls
checking: I find it highly plausible that one of the latter resembles i on balance more than any of the former.
18 syls
checking: 2.
error
checking: 3 Degrees of Similarity Roughly, A → C is true at i iff either (1) there is some degree of similarity to i within which there are A-worlds and C holds at all of them, or (2) there are no A-worlds within any degree of similarity to i. To avoid the questionable assumption that similarity of worlds admits somehow of numerical measurement, it seems best to identify each "degree of similarity to i" with a set of worlds regarded as the set of all worlds within that degree of similarity to i. Call a set S of worlds a sphere around i iff every S-world is accessible from i and is closer to i than is any S -world.
error
checking: Call a sphere A-permitting iff it contains some A-world.
error
checking: Letting spheres represent degrees of similarity, we have this reformulation: A → C is true at i iff A ⊃ C holds throughout some A-permitting sphere around i, if such there be.
error
checking: end p.12 To review our other operators: A → C is true at i iff AC holds somewhere in every Apermitting sphere around i, and there are such.
error
checking: A is true at i iff A holds throughout every sphere is true at i iff some around i. A is true at i iff A holds somewhere in some sphere around i. sphere around i permits A but not B. Finally, B is cotenable at i with the supposition that A iff B holds throughout some A-permitting sphere around i, if such there be.
error
checking: Restated in terms of spheres, the Limit Assumption says that if there is any A-permitting sphere around i, then there is a smallest one—the intersection of all A-permitting spheres is then itself an A-permitting sphere.
18 syls
checking: We can therefore reformulate Analysis 2 as: A → C is true at i iff A ⊃C holds throughout the smallest A-permitting sphere around i, if such there be.
error
checking: These systems of spheres may remind one of neighborhood systems in topology, but that would be a mistake.
20 syls
checking: The topological concept of closeness captured by means of neighborhoods is purely local and qualitative, not comparative: adjacent vs.
19 syls
checking: separated, no more.
6 syls
checking: Neighborhoods do not capture comparative closeness to a point because arbitrary supersets of neighborhoods of the point are themselves neighborhoods of a point.
18 syls
checking: The spheres around a world, on the other hand, are nested, wherefore they capture comparative closeness: j is closer to i than k is (according to the definition of spheres and the Ordering Assumption) iff some sphere around i includes j but excludes k. 2.
error
checking: 4 Higher-Order Quantification The formulation just given as a metalinguistic truth condition can also be stated, with the help of auxiliary apparatus, as an explicit definition in the object language.
error
checking: A □→ C = df ◊ A ⊃ ∃ S (ΦS & ◊SA &□ (SA ⊃ C)).
error
checking: Here the modalities are as before; "S" is an object-language variable over propositions; and Φ is a higher-order predicate satisfied at a world i by a proposition iff the set of all worlds where that proposition holds is a sphere around i. I have assumed that every set of worlds is the truth-set of some—perhaps inexpressible—proposition.
21 syls
checking: We could even quantify over modalities, these being understood as certain properties of propositions.
19 syls
checking: Call a modality spherical iff for every world i there is a sphere around i such that the modality belongs at i to all and only those propositions that hold throughout that sphere.
error
checking: end p.13 have  Letting ◇ be a variable over all spherical modalities, and letting ■ abbreviate − ◆ −, we  A□→ C = df ◊A ⊃ ∃ ■ (◆A & ■ (A ⊃ C)).
error
checking: This definition captures explicitly the idea that the counterfactual is a variably strict conditional.
error
checking: To speak of variable strictness, we should be able to compare the strictness of different spherical modalities.
error
checking: Call one modality (locally) stricter than another at a world i iff the second but not the first belongs to some proposition at i. Call two modalities comparable iff it does not happen that one is stricter at one world and the other at another.
18 syls
checking: Call one modality stricter than another iff they are comparable and the first is stricter at some world.
error
checking: Call one uniformly stricter than another iff it is stricter at every world.
error
checking: Comparative strictness is only a partial ordering of the spherical modalities: some pairs are incomparable.
error
checking: However, we can without loss restrict the range of our variable ◇ to a suitable subset of the spherical modalities on which comparative strictness is a linear ordering.
19 syls
checking: (Perhaps—iff the inclusion orderings of spheres around worlds all have the same order type—we can do better still, and use a subset linearly ordered by uniform comparative strictness.
error
checking: ) Unfortunately, these linear sets are not uniquely determined.
18 syls
checking: Example: suppose that comparative similarity has only a few gradations.
18 syls
checking: Suppose, for instance, that there are only five different (nonempty) spheres around each world.
error
checking: Let ◇ at i iff A holds throughout the innermost (nonempty) sphere around i: let ◇  2  1  A be true  A be true at i iff A  holds throughout the innermost-but-one; and likewise for ◇ 3 , ◇ 4 , and◇ 5 .
error
checking: Then the five spherical modalities expressed by these operators are a suitable linear set.
18 syls
checking: Since we have only a finite range, we can replace quantification by disjunction: A□→ C = df ◊ A ⊃ .

error
checking: 5 Impossible Limit-Worlds We were driven from Analysis 2 to Analysis 3 because we had reason to doubt the Limit Assumption.
error
checking: It seemed that sometimes there were closer and closer A-worlds to i without limit— that is, without any closest A-worlds.
18 syls
checking: None, at least, among the possible worlds.
10 syls
checking: But we  end p.14 can find the closest A-worlds instead among certain impossible worlds, if we are willing to look there.
error
checking: If we count these impossible worlds among the worlds to be considered, the Limit Assumption is rescued and we can safely return to Analysis 2.
18 syls
checking: There are various ways to introduce the impossible limits we need.
18 syls
checking: The following method is simplest, but others can be made to seem a little less ad hoc.
18 syls
checking: Suppose there are closer and closer (accessible, possible) A-worlds to i without limit; and suppose Σ is any maximal set of sentences such that, for any finite conjunction C of sentences in Σ, A → C holds at i according to Analysis 3.
18 syls
checking: (We can think of such a Σ as a full description of one—possible or impossible—way things might be if it were that A, from the standpoint of i.) Then we must posit an impossible limit-world where all of Σ holds.
18 syls
checking: It should be accessible from i alone; it should be closer to i than all the possible Aworlds; but it should be no closer to i than any possible world that is itself closer than all the possible A-worlds.
18 syls
checking: (Accessibility from, and comparative similarity to, the impossible limit-worlds is undefined.
18 syls
checking: Truth of sentences there is determined by the way in which these worlds were introduced as limits, not according to the ordinary truth conditions.
18 syls
checking: ) Obviously the Limit Assumption is satisfied once these impossible worlds have been added to the worlds under consideration.
20 syls
checking: It is easy to verify that the truth values of counterfactuals at possible worlds afterwards according to Analyses 2 and 3 alike agrees with their original truth values according to Analysis 3.
error
checking: The impossible worlds just posited are impossible in the least objectionable way.
18 syls
checking: The sentences true there may be incompatible, in that not all of them hold together at any possible world; but there is no (correct) way to derive any contradiction from them.
18 syls
checking: For a derivation proceeds from finitely many premises; and any finite subset of the sentences true at one of the limitworlds is true together at some possible world.
error
checking: Example: recall the failure of the Limit Assumption among possible worlds when A is "I am over 7 feet tall".
20 syls
checking: Our limit-worlds will be impossible worlds where A is true but all of "I am at least 7.

checking: (Do not confuse these with possible worlds where I am infinitesimally more than 7 feet tall.
error
checking: For all I know, there are such; but worlds where physical magnitudes can take "non-standard" values differing infinitesimally from a real number presumably differ from ours in a very fundamental way, making them far more remote from actuality than some of the standard worlds where I am, say, 7.
18 syls
checking: 1 feet tall.
error
checking: If so, "Physical magnitudes never take non-standard values" is end p.15 false at any possible world where I am infinitesimally more than 7 feet tall, but true at the impossible closest A-worlds to ours.
18 syls
checking: ) How bad is it to believe in these impossible limit-worlds?
16 syls
checking: Very bad, I think; but there is no reason not to reduce them to something less objectionable, such as sets of propositions or even sentences.
19 syls
checking: I do not like a parallel reduction of possible worlds, chiefly because it is incredible in the case of the possible world we happen to live in, and other possible worlds do not differ in kind from ours.
18 syls
checking: But this objection does not carry over to the impossible worlds.
18 syls
checking: We do not live in one of those, and possible and impossible worlds do differ in kind.
18 syls
checking: 2.
error
checking: 6 Selection Functions Analysis 2, vindicated either by trafficking in impossible worlds or by faith in the Limit Assumption even for possible worlds, may conveniently be reformulated by introducing a function f that selects, for any antecedent A and possible world i, the set of all closest (accessible) A-worlds to i (the empty set if there are none).
error
checking: A → C is true at a possible world i iff C holds throughout the selected set f(A, i).
error
checking: Stalnaker formulates Analysis 1 this way, except that his f(A, i) is the unique member of the selected set, if such there be, instead of the set itself.
error
checking: If we like, we can put the selection function into the object language; but to do this without forgetting that counterfactuals are in general contingent, we must have recourse to double indexing.

Then □(ƒA ⊃ C) is true at j in relation to i iff C holds at every world in f(A, i) that is accessible from j. It is therefore true at i in relation to i itself iff C holds throughout f(A, i)—that is, iff A → C holds at i. Introducing an operator † such that † B is true at i in relation to j iff B is true at i in relation to i itself, we can define the counterfactual: A □→ C =df † □(ƒA ⊃ C).

error

18 syls

20 syls
checking: An independent complication: since closeness of worlds and counterpart relations among their inhabitants are alike matters of comparative similarity, the two are interdependent.
18 syls
checking: At a world close to ours, the inhabitants of our world will mostly have close counterparts; at a world very different from ours, nothing can be a very close counterpart of anything at our world.
19 syls
checking: We might therefore wish to fuse closeness of worlds and closeness of counterparts, allowing these to balance off.
18 syls
checking: Working with comparative similarity among pairs of a concrete thing and the world it inhabits (and ignoring provision for vacuity and for accessibility restrictions), we could say that an inhabitant x of a world i satisfies A(x) → C(x) at i iff some such thing-world pair <y, j> such that y satisfies A(x) and C(x) at j is more similar to the pair <x, i> than is any pair <z, k> such that z satisfies A(x) and C (x) at k.

18 syls
checking: The intended models, for the counterfactual case, are those in which I, R, ≤, and really are what we regarded them as being: the set of worlds, some reasonable accessibility relation, some reasonable family of comparative similarity orderings, and an appropriate assignment to sentences of truth sets.
error
checking: The Ordering Assumption has been written into the very definition of a model (clause 3) since it is common to the counterfactual case and the analogous cases as well.

checking: The general soundness and completeness result still holds if we end p.28 replace the local conditions (U −) and (A −) by the stronger global conditions (U) and (A).
18 syls
checking: (U) (uniformity): For any i, j, k in I, jRk iff iRk.
error
checking: (A) (absoluteness): For any h, i, j, k in I, jRk iff iRk and h ≤ j k iff h ≤ i k. Any model meeting (U −) or (A −) can be divided up into models meeting (U) or (A).
error
checking: The other listed conditions hold in the models produced by the division if they held in the original model.
20 syls
checking: Therefore a sentence is valid under a combination of conditions including (U) or (A) iff it is valid under the combination that results from weakening (U) to (U −), or (A) to (A −).
19 syls
checking: In the presence of (C), (W), or (T), condition (U) is equivalent to the condition: for any i and j in I, iRj.
20 syls
checking: VCU is thus the correct system to use if we want to drop accessibility restrictions.
error
checking: VW, or perhaps VWU, is the correct system for anyone who wants to invalidate the implication from A and C to A → C by allowing that another world might be just as close to a given world as that world is to itself.
error
checking: VCS, or VCUS if we drop accessibility restrictions, is the system corresponding to Analysis 1 or .
error
checking: VCS is definitionally equivalent to Stalnaker's system C2.
error
checking: The systems given by various combinations of N, T, U, and A apply, under various assumptions, to the deontic case.
18 syls
checking: VN is definitionally equivalent to a system CD given by van Fraassen in "The Logic of Conditional Obligation", and shown there to be sound and complete for the class of what we may call multi-positional models meeting (N).
error
checking: These differ from models in my sense in that a world may occur at more than one position in an ordering ≤ i .
18 syls
checking: (Motivation: different positions may be assigned to one world qua realizer of different kinds of value.
18 syls
checking: ) Technically, we no longer have a direct ordering of the worlds themselves; rather, we have for each i in I a linear ordering of some set V i and an assignment to each world j such that iRj of one or more members of  V i , regarded as giving the positions of j in the ordering from the standpoint of i. A ≺ B is true at i iff some position assigned to some A-world j (such that iRj) is better according to the given ordering than any position assigned to any B-world.
18 syls
checking: My models are essentially the same as those multipositional models in which no world does have more than one assigned position in any of the orderings.
error
checking: Hence CD is at least as strong as VN; but no stronger, since VN is already sound for all multi-positional models meeting (N).
error
checking: All the systems are decidable.
error
checking: To decide whether a given sentence A end p.29 is a theorem of a given system, it is enough to decide whether the validity of A under the corresponding combination of conditions can be refuted by a small countermodel—one with at most 2n worlds, where n is the number of subsentences of A. (Take (U) and (A), rather than (U−) and (A−), as the conditions corresponding to U and A.) That can be decided by examining finitely many cases, since it is unnecessary to consider two models separately if they are isomorphic, or if they have the same I, R, ≤, and the same P whenever P is a sentence letter of A. If A is a theorem, then by soundness there is no countermodel and a fortiori no small countermodel.
error
checking: If A is not a theorem, then by completeness there is a countermodel < I, R, ≤, >.
error
checking: We derive thence a small countermodel, called a filtration of the original countermodel, as follows.
error
checking: Let D i , for each i in I, be the conjunction in some definite arbitrary order of all the subsentences of A that are true at i in the original countermodel, together with the negations of all the subsentences of A that are false at i in * the original countermodel.
18 syls
checking: Now let < I*, R*, ≤*, > be as follows: * (1) I is a subset of I containing exactly one member of each nonempty D i ; (2) for any i and j in I*, iR*j iff i is in Dj ; (3) for any i, j, k in I*, j ≤ k iff i is in D ≼ D ; i  j  k  (4) for any sentence letter P, P * is P ∩ I*; for any compound sentence B, B * is * such that <I*, R*, ≤*, > meets conditions (5) and (6) in the definition of a model.
error
checking: * Then it may easily be shown that <I*, R*, ≤*, > is a small counter-model to the validity of A under the appropriate combination of conditions, and thereby to the theoremhood of A in the given system.

15 syls

19 syls
checking: The way the future is depends counterfactually on the way the present is.
error
checking: If the present were different, the future would be different; and there are counterfactual conditionals, many of them as unquestionably true as counterfactuals ever get, that tell us a good deal about how the future would be different if the present were different in various ways.
18 syls
checking: Likewise the present depends counterfactually on the past, and in general the way things are later depends on the way things were earlier.
error
checking: Not so in reverse.
5 syls
checking: Seldom, if ever, can we find a clearly true counterfactual about how the past would be different if the present were somehow different.
error
checking: Such a counterfactual, unless clearly false, normally is not clear one way or the other.
error
checking: It is at best doubtful whether the past depends counterfactually on the present, whether the present depends end p.32 on the future, and in general whether the way things are earlier depends on the way things will be later.
error
checking: Often, indeed, we seem to reason in a way that takes it for granted that the past is counterfactually independent of the present: that is, that even if the present were different, the past would be just as it actually is.
18 syls
checking: In reasoning from a counterfactual supposition, we use auxiliary premises drawn from (what we take to be) our factual knowledge.
error
checking: But not just anything we know may be used, since some truths would not be true under the given supposition.
18 syls
checking: If the supposition concerns the present, we do not feel free to use all we know about the future.
18 syls
checking: If the supposition were true, the future would be different and some things we know about the actual future might not hold in this different counterfactual future.
18 syls
checking: But we do feel free, ordinarily, to use whatever we know about the past.
19 syls
checking: We evidently assume that even if our supposition about the present were true, the past would be no different.
19 syls
checking: If I were acting otherwise just now, I would revenge a wrong done me last year—it is absurd even to raise the question whether that past wrong would have taken place if I were acting otherwise now!
18 syls
checking: More generally, in reasoning from a counterfactual supposition about any time, we ordinarily assume that facts about earlier times are counterfactually independent of the supposition and so may freely be used as auxiliary premises.
error
checking: I would like to present a neat contrast between counterfactual dependence in one direction of time and counterfactual independence in the other direction.
error
checking: But until a distinction is made, the situation is not as neat as that.
18 syls
checking: There are some special contexts that complicate matters.
13 syls
checking: We know that present conditions have their past causes.
13 syls
checking: We can persuade ourselves, and sometimes do, that if the present were different then these past causes would have to be different, else they would have caused the present to be as it actually is.
20 syls
checking: Given such an argument—call it a back-tracking argument—we willingly grant that if the present were different, the past would be different too.
20 syls
checking: I borrow an example from Downing ([5]).
error
checking: Jim and Jack quarreled yesterday, and Jack is still hopping mad.
15 syls
checking: We conclude that if Jim asked Jack for help today, Jack would not help him.
17 syls
added: We conclude that if Jim asked Jack for help today, Jack would not help him.
checking: But wait: Jim is a prideful fellow.
error
checking: He never would ask for help after such a quarrel; if Jim were to ask Jack for help today, there would have to have been no quarrel yesterday.
18 syls
checking: In that case Jack would be his usual generous self.
14 syls
checking: So if Jim asked Jack for help today, Jack would help him after all.
16 syls
checking: At this stage we may be persuaded (and rightly so, I think) that if Jim asked Jack for help today, there would have been no quarrel yesterday.
18 syls
checking: end p.33  But the persuasion does not last.
error
checking: We very easily slip back into our usual sort of counterfactual reasoning, and implicitly assume once again that facts about earlier times are counterfactually independent of facts about later times.
error
checking: Consider whether pride is costly.
9 syls
checking: In this case, at least, it costs Jim nothing.
10 syls
checking: It would be useless for Jim to ask Jack for help, since Jack would not help him.
18 syls
checking: We rely once more on the premise we recently doubted: if Jim asked Jack for help today, the quarrel would nevertheless have taken place yesterday.
18 syls
checking: What is going on, I suggest, can best be explained as follows.
16 syls
checking: (1) Counterfactuals are infected with vagueness, as everyone agrees.
error
checking: Different ways of (partly) resolving the vagueness are appropriate in different contexts.
18 syls
checking: Remember the case of Caesar in Korea: had he been in command, would he have used the atom bomb?
18 syls
checking: Or would he have used catapults?
8 syls
checking: It is right to say either, though not to say both together.
15 syls
checking: Each is true under a resolution of vagueness appropriate to some contexts.
18 syls
checking: (2) We ordinarily resolve the vagueness of counterfactuals in such a way that counterfactual dependence is asymmetric (except perhaps in cases of time travel or the like).
error
checking: Under this standard resolution, back-tracking arguments are mistaken: if the present were different the past would be the same, but the same past causes would fail somehow to cause the same present effects.
19 syls
checking: If Jim asked Jack for help today, somehow Jim would have overcome his pride and asked despite yesterday's quarrel.
18 syls
checking: (3) Some special contexts favor a different resolution of vagueness, one under which the past depends counterfactually on the present and some back-tracking arguments are correct.
error
checking: If someone propounds a back-tracking argument, for instance, his co-operative partners in conversation will switch to a resolution that gives him a chance to be right.
error
checking: (This sort of accommodating shift in abstract features of context is common; see Lewis ([14]).
18 syls
checking: ) But when the need for a special resolution of vagueness comes to an end, the standard resolution returns.
18 syls
checking: (4) A counterfactual saying that the past would be different if the present were somehow different may come out true under the special resolution of its vagueness, but false under the standard resolution.
error
checking: If so, call it a back-tracking counterfactual.
error
checking: Taken out of context, it will not be clearly true or clearly false.
17 syls
added: Taken out of context, it will not be clearly true or clearly false.
checking: Although we tend to favor the standard resolution, we also charitably tend to favor a resolution which gives the sentence under consideration a chance of truth.
21 syls
checking: (Back-tracking counterfactuals, used in a context that favors their truth, are marked by a syntactic peculiarity.
error
checking: They are the ones in which the usual subjunctive conditional constructions are readily end p.34 replaced by more complicated constructions: "If it were that .

12 syls
checking: Three paragraphs ago, I used such constructions to lure you into a context that favors back-tracking.
18 syls
checking: ) I have distinguished the standard resolution of vagueness from the sort that permits backtracking only so that I can ask you to ignore the latter.
18 syls
checking: Only under the standard resolution do we have the clear-cut asymmetry of counterfactual dependence that interests me.
21 syls
checking: I do not claim that the asymmetry holds in all possible, or even all actual, cases.
19 syls
checking: It holds for the sorts of familiar cases that arise in everyday life.
18 syls
checking: But it well might break down in the different conditions that might obtain in a time machine, or at the edge of a black hole, or before the Big Bang, or after the Heat Death, or at a possible world consisting of one solitary atom in the void.
18 syls
checking: It may also break down with respect to the immediate past.
16 syls
checking: We shall return to these matters later.
10 syls
checking: Subject to these needed qualifications, what I claim is as follows.
18 syls
checking: Consider those counterfactuals of the form "If it were that A, then it would be that C" in which the supposition A is indeed false, and in which A and C are entirely about the states of affairs at two times t A and t C respectively.
error
checking: Many such counterfactuals are true in which C also is false, and in which t C is later than t A .
error
checking: These are counterfactuals that say how the way things are later depends on the way things were earlier.
error
checking: But if t C is earlier than t A , then such counterfactuals are true if and only if C is true.
error
checking: These are the counterfactuals that tell us how the way things are earlier does not depend on the way things will be later.
error
checking: Asymmetries of Causation and Openness The asymmetry of counterfactual dependence has been little discussed.
18 syls
checking: (However, see Downing [5], Bennett [2], and Slote [19].
error
checking: ) Some of its consequences are better known.
11 syls
checking: It is instructive to see how the asymmetry of counterfactual dependence serves to explain these more familiar asymmetries.
error
checking: Consider the temporal asymmetry of causation.
15 syls
checking: Effects do not precede their causes, or at least not ordinarily.
18 syls
checking: Elsewhere ([12]) I have advocated a counterfactual analysis of causation: (1) the relation of end p.35 cause to effect consists in their being linked by a causal chain; (2) a causal chain is a certain kind of chain of counterfactual dependences; and (3) the counterfactuals involved are to be taken under the standard resolution of vagueness.
error
checking: If anything of the sort is right, there can be no backward causation without counterfactual dependence of past on future.
18 syls
checking: Only where the asymmetry of counterfactual dependence breaks down can there possibly be exceptions to the predominant futureward direction of causation.
error
checking: Consider also what I shall call the asymmetry of openness: the obscure contrast we draw between the "open future" and the "fixed past".
18 syls
checking: We tend to regard the future as a multitude of alternative possibilities, a "garden of forking paths" in Borges' phrase, whereas we regard the past as a unique, settled, immutable actuality.
18 syls
checking: These descriptions scarcely wear their meaning on their sleeves, yet do seem to capture some genuine and important difference between past and future.
19 syls
checking: What can it be?
4 syls
checking: Several hypotheses do not seem quite satisfactory.
14 syls
checking: Hypothesis 1: Asymmetry of Epistemic Possibility.
error
checking: Is it just that we know more about the past than about the future, so that the future is richer in epistemic possibilities?
18 syls
checking: I think that's not it.
6 syls
checking: The epistemic contrast is a matter of degree, not a difference in kind, and sometimes is not very pronounced.
error
checking: There is a great deal we know about the future, and a great deal we don't know about the past.
18 syls
checking: Ignorance of history has not the least tendency to make (most of) us think of the past as somewhat future-like, multiple, open, or unfixed.
18 syls
checking: Hypothesis 2: Asymmetry of Multiple Actuality.
error
checking: Is it that all our possible futures are equally actual?
18 syls
checking: It is possible, I think, to make sense of multiple actuality.
19 syls
checking: Elsewhere I have argued for two theses (in [9] and [8]): (1) any inhabitant of any possible world may truly call his own world actual; (2) we ourselves inhabit this one world only, and are not identical with our other-worldly counterparts.
error
checking: Both theses are controversial, so perhaps I am right about one and wrong about the other.
18 syls
checking: If (1) is true and (2) is false, here we are inhabiting several worlds at once and truly calling all of them actual.
error
checking: (Adams argues contra-positively in [1], arguing from the denial of multiple actuality and the denial of (2) to the denial of (1).
error
checking: ) That makes sense, I think, but it gives us no asymmetry.
14 syls
checking: For in some sufficiently broad sense of possibility, we have alternative possible pasts as well as alternative possible futures.
21 syls
checking: But if (1) is true and (2) is false, that means that all our possibilities are equally actual, past as well as future.
error
checking: end p.36 Hypothesis 3:Asymmetry of Indeterminism.
error
checking: Is it that we think of our world as governed by indeterministic laws of nature, so that the actual past and present are nomically compossible with various alternative future continuations?
error
checking: I think this hypothesis also fails.
10 syls
checking: For one thing, it is less certain that our world is indeterministic than that there is an asymmetry between open future and fixed past—whatever that may turn out to be.
error
checking: Our best reason to believe in indeterminism is the success of quantum mechanics, but that reason is none too good until quantum mechanics succeeds in giving a satisfactory account of processes of measurement.
error
checking: For another thing, such reason as we have to believe in indeterminism is reason to believe that the laws of nature are indeterministic in both directions, so that the actual future and present are nomically compossible with various alternative pasts.
error
checking: If there is a process of reduction of the wave packet in which a given superposition may be followed by any of many eigenstates, equally this is a  process in which a given eigenstate may have been preceded by any of many superpositions.
18 syls
checking: Again we have no asymmetry.
9 syls
checking: I believe that indeterminism is neither necessary nor sufficient for the asymmetries I am discussing.
error
checking: Therefore I shall ignore the possibility of indeterminism in the rest of this paper, and see how the asymmetries might arise even under strict determinism.
error
checking: A deterministic system of laws is one such that, whenever two possible worlds both obey the laws perfectly, then either they are exactly alike throughout all of time, or else they are not exactly alike through any stretch of time.
18 syls
checking: They are alike always or never.
9 syls
checking: They do not diverge, matching perfectly in their initial segments but not thereafter; neither do they converge.
18 syls
checking: Let us assume, for the sake of the argument, that the laws of nature of our actual world are in this sense deterministic.
18 syls
checking: (My definition of determinism derives from Montague ([15]), but with modifications.
error
checking: (1) I prefer to avoid his use of mathematical constructions as ersatz possible worlds.
error
checking: But should you prefer ersatz worlds to the real thing, that will not matter for the purposes of this paper.
18 syls
checking: (2) I take exact likeness of worlds at times as a primitive relation; Montague instead uses the relation of having the same complete description in a certain language, which he leaves unspecified.
error
checking: My definition presupposes that we can identify stretches of time from one world to another.
18 syls
checking: That presupposition is questionable, but it could be avoided at the cost of some complication).
18 syls
checking: Hypothesis 4: Asymmetry of Mutability.
error
checking: Is it that we can change the future, but not the past?
13 syls
checking: Not so, if "change" has its literal meaning.
11 syls
checking: end p.37 It is true enough that if t is any past time, then we cannot bring about a difference between the state of affairs at t at time t 1 and the (supposedly changed) state of affairs at t at a later time t 2 .
error
checking: But the pastness of t is irrelevant; the same would be true if t were present or future.
error
checking: Past, present, and future are alike immutable.
13 syls
checking: What explains the impossibility is that such phrases as "the state of affairs at t at t 1 " or "the state of affairs at t at t 2 ", if they mean anything, just mean: the state of affairs at t. Of course we cannot bring about a difference between that and itself.
18 syls
checking: Final Hypothesis: Asymmetry of Counterfactual Dependence.
error
checking: Our fourth hypothesis was closer to the truth than the others.
17 syls
added: Our fourth hypothesis was closer to the truth than the others.
checking: What we can do by way of "changing the future" (so to speak) is to bring it about that the future is the way it actually will be, rather than any of the other ways it would have been if we acted differently in the present.
18 syls
checking: That is something like change.
6 syls
checking: We make a difference.
6 syls
checking: But it is not literally change, since the difference we make is between actuality and other possibilities, not between successive actualities.
19 syls
checking: The literal truth is just that the future depends counterfactually on the present.
error
checking: It depends, partly, on what we do now.
10 syls
checking: Likewise, something we ordinarily cannot do by way of "changing the past" is to bring it about that the past is the way it actually was, rather than some other way it would have been if we acted differently in the present.
18 syls
checking: The past would be the same, however we acted now.
13 syls
checking: The past does not at all depend on what we do now.
13 syls
checking: It is counterfactually independent of the present.
error
checking: In short, I suggest that the mysterious asymmetry between open future and fixed past is nothing else than the asymmetry of counterfactual dependence.
19 syls
checking: The forking paths into the future— the actual one and all the rest—are the many alternative futures that would come about under various counterfactual suppositions about the present.
18 syls
checking: The one actual, fixed past is the one past that would remain actual under this same range of suppositions.
18 syls
checking: Two Analyses of Counterfactuals I hope I have now convinced you that an asymmetry of counterfactual dependence exists; that it has important consequences; and therefore that it had better be explained by any satisfactory semantic analysis of counterfactual conditionals.
error
checking: In the rest of this paper, I shall consider how that explanation ought to work.
18 syls
checking: end p.38 It might work by fiat.
error
checking: It is an easy matter to build the asymmetry into an analysis of counterfactuals, for instance as follows.
21 syls
checking: ANALYSIS 1.
error
checking: Consider a counterfactual "If it were that A, then it would be that C" where A is entirely about affairs in a stretch of time t A .
error
checking: Consider all those possible worlds w such that: (1) A is true at w; (2) w is exactly like our actual world at all times before a transition period beginning shortly before t A ; (3) w conforms to the actual laws of nature at all times after t A ; and (4) during t A and the preceding transition period, w differs no more from our actual world than it must to permit A to hold.
error
checking: The counterfactual is true if and only if C holds at every such world w. In short, take the counterfactual present (if t A is now), avoiding gratuitous difference from the actual present; graft it smoothly onto the actual past; let the situation evolve according to the actual laws; and see what happens.
error
checking: An analysis close to Analysis 1 has been put forward by Jackson ([7]).
error
checking: Bennett ([2]), Bowie ([3]), and Weiner ([21]) have considered, but not endorsed, similar treatments.
error
checking: Analysis 1 guarantees the asymmetry of counterfactual dependence, with an exception for the immediate past.
error
checking: Let C be entirely about a stretch of time t C .
15 syls
checking: If t C is later than t A , then C may very well be false at our world, yet true at the worlds that meet the conditions listed in Analysis 1.
18 syls
checking: We have the counterfactuals whereby the affairs of later times depend on those of earlier times.
error
checking: But if t C is before t A , and also before the transition period, then C holds at worlds that meet condition (2) if and only if C is true at our actual world.
18 syls
checking: Since C is entirely about something that does not differ at all from one of these worlds to another, its truth value cannot vary.
18 syls
checking: Therefore, except for cases in which t C falls in the transition period, we have the counterfactuals whereby the affairs of earlier times are independent of those of later times.
20 syls
checking: We need the transition period, and should resist any temptation to replace (2) by the simpler and stronger (2*) w is exactly like our actual world at all times before t A .
18 syls
checking: (2*) makes for abrupt discontinuities.
error
checking: Right up to t, the match was stationary and a foot away from the striking surface.
18 syls
checking: If it had been end p.39 struck at t, would it have travelled a foot in no time at all?
error
checking: No; we should sacrifice the independence of the immediate past to provide an orderly transition from actual past to counterfactual present and future.
18 syls
checking: That is not to say, however, that the immediate past depends on the present in any very definite way.
18 syls
checking: There may be a variety of ways the transition might go, hence there may be no true counterfactuals that say in any detail how the immediate past would be if the present were different.
18 syls
checking: I hope not, since if there were a definite and detailed dependence, it would be hard for me to say why some of this dependence should not be interpreted—wrongly, of course—as backward causation over short intervals of time in cases that are not at all extraordinary.
18 syls
checking: Analysis 1 seems to fit a wide range of counterfactuals; and it explains the asymmetry of counterfactual dependence, though with one rather plausible exception.
error
checking: Should we be content?
5 syls
checking: I fear not, for two reasons.
7 syls
checking: First, Analysis 1 is built for a special case.
error

10 syls
checking: Analysis 1 cannot cope as it stands, nor is there any obvious way to generalize it.
error
checking: At most we could give separate treatments of other cases, drawing on the cases handled by Analysis 1.
18 syls
checking: (Jackson ([7]) does this to some extent.
error
checking: ) Analysis 1 is not much of a start toward a uniform treatment of counterfactuals in general.
error
checking: Second, Analysis 1 gives us more of an asymmetry than we ought to want.
error
checking: No matter how special the circumstances of the case may be, no provision whatever is made for actual or possible  exceptions to the asymmetry (except in the transition period).
20 syls
checking: That is too inflexible.
7 syls
checking: Careful readers have thought they could make sense of stories of time travel (see my [13] for further discussion); hard-headed psychical researchers have believed in precognition; speculative physicists have given serious consideration to tachyons, advanced potentials, and cosmological models with closed timelike curves.
18 syls
checking: Most or all of these phenomena would involve special exceptions to the normal asymmetry end p.40 of counterfactual dependence.
18 syls
checking: It will not do to declare them impossible a priori.
error
checking: The asymmetry-by-fiat strategy of Analysis 1 is an instructive error, not a dead loss.
error
checking: Often we do have the right sort of supposition, the standard resolution of vagueness, and no extraordinary circumstances.
20 syls
checking: Then Analysis 1 works as well as we could ask.
error
checking: The right analysis of counterfactuals needs to be both more general and more flexible.
error
checking: But also it needs to agree with Analysis 1 over the wide range of cases for which Analysis 1 succeeds.
error
checking: The right general analysis of counterfactuals, in my opinion, is one based on comparative similarity of possible worlds.
error
checking: Roughly, a counterfactual is true if every world that makes the antecedent true without gratuitous departure from actuality is a world that also makes the consequent true.
error
checking: Such an analysis is given in my [10] and [11]; here is one formulation.
error
checking: ANALYSIS 2.
error
checking: A counterfactual "If it were that A, then it would be that C" is (nonvacuously) true if and only if some (accessible) world where both A and C are true is more similar to our actual world, overall, than is any world where A is true but C is false.
error
checking: This analysis is fully general: A can be a supposition of any sort.
19 syls
checking: It is also extremely vague.
8 syls
checking: Overall similarity among worlds is some sort of resultant of similarities and differences of many different kinds, and I have not said what system of weights or priorities should be used to squeeze these down into a single relation of overall similarity.
18 syls
checking: I count that a virtue.
6 syls
checking: Counterfactuals are both vague and various.
error
checking: Different resolutions of the vagueness of overall similarity are appropriate in different contexts.
20 syls
checking: Analysis 2 (plus some simple observations about the formal character of comparative similarity) is about all that can be said in full generality about counterfactuals.
error
checking: While not devoid of testable content—it settles some questions of logic—it does little to predict the truth values of particular counterfactuals in particular contexts.
error
checking: The rest of the study of counterfactuals is not fully general.
error
checking: Analysis 2 is only a skeleton.
error
checking: It must be fleshed out with an account of the appropriate similarity relation, and this will differ from context to context.
20 syls
checking: Our present task is to see what sort of similarity relation can be combined with Analysis 2 to yield what I have called the standard resolution of vagueness: one that invalidates back-tracking arguments, one that yields an asymmetry of counterfactual dependence except end p.41 perhaps under special circumstances, one that agrees with Analysis 1, our asymmetry-byfiat analysis, whenever it ought to.
19 syls
checking: But first, a word of warning!
7 syls
checking: Do not assume that just any respect of similarity you can think of must enter into the balance of overall similarity with positive weight.
18 syls
checking: The point is obvious for some respects of similarity, if such they be.
18 syls
checking: It contributes nothing to the similarity of two gemstones that both are grue.
18 syls
checking: (To be grue is to be green and first examined before 2000 A.D. or blue and not first examined before 2000 A.D.) But even some similarities in less gruesome respects may count for nothing.
error
checking: They may have zero weight, at least under some reasonable resolutions of vagueness.
19 syls
checking: To what extent are the philosophical writings of Wittgenstein similar, overall, to those of Heidegger?
error
checking: I don't know.
4 syls
checking: But here is one respect of comparison that does not enter into it at all, not even with negligible weight: the ratio of vowels to consonants.
18 syls
checking: (Bowie ([3]) has argued that if some respects of comparison counted for nothing, my assumption of "centering" in [10] and [11] would be violated: worlds differing from ours only in the respects that don't count would be as similar to our world as our world is to itself.
error
checking: I reply that there may not be any worlds that differ from ours only in the respects that don't count, even if there are some respects that don't count.
19 syls
checking: Respects of comparison may not be entirely separable.
error
checking: If the  writings of two philosophers were alike in every respect that mattered, they would be word-forword the same; then they would have the same ratio of vowels to consonants.
19 syls
checking: ) And next, another word of warning!
9 syls
checking: It is all too easy to make offhand similarity judgments and then assume that they will do for all purposes.
18 syls
checking: But if we respect the extreme shiftiness and context-dependence of similarity, we will not set much store by offhand judgments.
error
checking: We will be prepared to distinguish between the similarity relations that guide our offhand explicit judgments and those that govern our counterfactuals in various contexts.
20 syls
checking: Indeed, unless we are prepared so to distinguish, Analysis 2 faces immediate refutation.
error
checking: Sometimes a pair of counterfactuals of the following form seem true: "If A, the world would be very different; but if A and B, the world would not be very different".
error
checking: Only if the similarity relation governing counterfactuals disagrees with that governing explicit judgments of what is "very different" can such a pair be true under Analysis 2.
error
checking: (I owe this argument to Pavel Tichý and, in a slightly different form, to Richard J. Hall.
error
checking: ) It seems to me no surprise, given the instability even of explicit judgments of similarity, that two different end p.42 comparative similarity relations should enter into the interpretation of a single sentence.
18 syls
checking: The thing to do is not to start by deciding, once and for all, what we think about similarity of worlds, so that we can afterwards use these decisions to test Analysis 2.
18 syls
checking: What that would test would be the combination of Analysis 2 with a foolish denial of the shiftiness of similarity.
error
checking: Rather, we must use what we know about the truth and falsity of counterfactuals to see if we can find some sort of similarity relation—not necessarily the first one that springs to mind—that combines with Analysis 2 to yield the proper truth conditions.
error
checking: It is this combination that can be tested against our knowledge of counterfactuals, not Analysis 2 by itself.
18 syls
checking: In looking for a combination that will stand up to the test, we must use what we know about counterfactuals to find out about the appropriate similarity relation—not the other way around.
18 syls
checking: The Future Similarity Objection Several people have raised what they take to be a serious objection against Analysis 2.
18 syls
checking: (It was first brought to my attention by Michael Slote; it occurs, in various forms, in [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [17], [18], and [19].
error
checking: Kit Fine ([6]: 452) states it as follows.
error
checking: The counterfactual "If Nixon had pressed the button there would have been a nuclear holocaust" is true or can be imagined to be so.
error
checking: Now suppose that there never will be a nuclear holocaust.
16 syls
checking: Then that counterfactual is, on Lewis's analysis, very likely false.
error
checking: For given any world in which antecedent and consequent are both true it will be easy to imagine a closer world in which the antecedent is true and the consequent false.
18 syls
checking: For we need only imagine a change that prevents the holocaust but that does not require such a great divergence from reality.
18 syls
checking: The presence or absence of a nuclear holocaust surely does contribute with overwhelming weight to some prominent similarity relations.
20 syls
checking: (For instance, to one that governs the explicit judgment of similarity in the consequent of "If Nixon had pressed the button, the world would be very different".
20 syls
checking: ) But the relation that governs the counterfactual may not be one of these.
error
checking: It may nevertheless be a relation of overall similarity—not because it is likely to guide our explicit judgments of similarity, but rather because it is a resultant, under some system of weights or priorities, of a multitude of relations of similarity in particular respects.
20 syls
checking: end p.43 Let us take the supposition that Nixon pressed the button as implicitly referring to a particular time t—let it be the darkest moment of the final days.
error
checking: Consider w 0 , a world that may or may not be ours.
error
checking: At w 0 , Nixon does not press the button at t and no nuclear holocaust ever occurs.
error
checking: Let w 0 also be a world with deterministic laws, since we have confined our attention here to counterfactual dependence under determinism.
error
checking: Let w 0 also be a world that fits our worst fantasies about the button: there is such a button, it is connected to a fully automatic command and control system, the wired-in war plan consists of one big salvo, everything is in faultless working order,  there is no way for anyone to stop the attack, and so on.
error
checking: Then I agree that Fine's counterfactual is true at w 0 : if Nixon had pressed the button, there would have been a nuclear holocaust.
error
checking: There are all sorts of worlds where Nixon (or rather, a counterpart of Nixon) presses the button at t. We must consider which of these differ least, under the appropriate similarity relation, from w 0 .
19 syls
checking: Some are non-starters.
5 syls
checking: Those where the payload of the rockets consists entirely of confetti depart gratuitously from w 0 by any reasonable standards.
19 syls
checking: The more serious candidates fall into several classes.
15 syls
checking: One class is typified by the world w 1 .
error
checking: Until shortly before t, w 1 is exactly like w 0 .
error
checking: The two match perfectly in every detail of particular fact, however minute.
18 syls
checking: Shortly before t, however, the spatio-temporal region of perfect match comes to an end as w 1 and w 0 begin to diverge.
error
checking: The deterministic laws of w 0 are violated at w 1 in some simple, localized, inconspicuous way.
error
checking: A tiny miracle takes place.
8 syls
checking: Perhaps a few extra neurons fire in some corner of Nixon's brain.
18 syls
checking: As a result of this, Nixon presses the button.
13 syls
checking: With no further miracles events take their lawful course and the two worlds w 1 and w 0 go their separate ways.
18 syls
checking: The holocaust takes place.
6 syls
checking: From that point on, at least so far as the surface of this planet is concerned, the two worlds are not even approximately similar in matters of particular fact.
19 syls
checking: In short, the worlds typified by w 1 are the worlds that meet the conditions listed in Analysis 1, our asymmetry-by-fiat analysis.
error
checking: What is the case throughout these worlds is just what we think would have been the case if Nixon had pressed the button (assuming that we are at w 0 , and operating under the standard resolution of vagueness).
18 syls
checking: Therefore, the worlds typified by w 1 should turn out to be more similar to w 0 , under the similarity relation we seek, than any of the other worlds where Nixon pressed the button.
error
checking: (When I say that a miracle takes place at w 1 , I mean that there is a violation of the laws of nature.
error
checking: But note that the violated laws are not laws of the same world where they are violated.
18 syls
checking: That is impossible; end p.44 whatever else a law may be, it is at least an exceptionless regularity.
error
checking: I am using "miracle" to express a relation between different worlds.
19 syls
checking: A miracle at w 1 , relative to w 0 , is a violation at w 1 of the laws of w 0 , which are at best the almost-laws of w 1 .
error
checking: The laws of w 1 itself, if such there be, do not enter into it.
error
checking: ) A second class of candidates is typified by w 2 .
error
checking: This is a world completely free of miracles: the deterministic laws of w 0 are obeyed perfectly.
18 syls
checking: However, w 2 differs from w 0 in that Nixon pressed the button.
error
checking: By definition of determinism, w 2 and w 0 are alike always or alike never, and they are not alike always.
error
checking: Therefore, they are not exactly alike through any stretch of time.
16 syls
checking: They differ even in the remote past.
10 syls
checking: What is worse, there is no guarantee whatever that w 2 can be chosen so that the differences diminish and eventually become negligible in the more and more remote past.
error
checking: Indeed, it is hard to imagine how two deterministic worlds anything like ours could possibly remain just a little bit different for very long.
20 syls
processed: 1000
checking: There are altogether too many opportunities for little differences to give rise to bigger differences.
21 syls
checking: Certainly such worlds as w 2 should not turn out to be the most similar worlds to w 0 where Nixon pressed the button.
error
checking: That would lead to back-tracking unlimited.
11 syls
checking: (And as Bennett observes in [2], it would make counterfactuals useless; we know far too little to figure out which of them are true under a resolution of vagueness that validates very much back-tracking.
error
checking: ) The lesson we learn by comparing w 1 and w 2 is that under the similarity relation we seek, a lot of perfect match of particular fact is worth a little miracle.
error
checking: A third class of candidates is typified by w 3 .
error
checking: This world begins like w 1 .
error
checking: Until shortly before t, w 3 is exactly like w 0 .
error
checking: Then a tiny miracle takes place, permitting divergence.
15 syls
checking: Nixon presses the button at t. But there is no holocaust, because soon after t a second tiny miracle takes place, just as simple and localized and inconspicuous as the first.
18 syls
checking: The fatal signal vanishes on its way from the button to the rockets.
19 syls
checking: Thereafter events at w 3 take their lawful course.
error
checking: At least for a while, worlds w 0 and w 3 remain very closely similar in matters of particular fact.
error
checking: But they are no longer exactly alike.
11 syls
checking: The holocaust has been prevented, but Nixon's deed has left its mark on the world w 3 .
18 syls
checking: There are his finger-prints on the button.
10 syls
checking: Nixon is still trembling, wondering what went  wrong—or right.
15 syls
checking: His gin bottle is depleted.
8 syls
checking: The click of the button has been preserved on tape.
12 syls
checking: Light waves that flew out the window, bearing the image of Nixon's finger on the button, are still on their way into outer space.
19 syls
checking: The wire is ever so slightly warmed where the signal current passed through it.
18 syls
checking: And so on, and on, and on.
7 syls
checking: The differences end p.45 between w 3 and w 0 are many and varied, although no one of them amounts to much.
error
checking: I should think that the close similarity between w 3 and w 0 could not last.
error
checking: Some of the little differences would give rise to bigger differences sooner or later.
19 syls
checking: Maybe Nixon's memoirs are more sanctimonious at w 3 than at w 0 .
18 syls
checking: Consequently they have a different impact on the character of a few hundred out of the millions who read them.
18 syls
checking: A few of these few hundred make different decisions at crucial moments of their lives—and we're off!
19 syls
checking: But if you are not convinced that the differences need increase, no matter.
19 syls
checking: My case will not depend on that.
8 syls
checking: If Analysis 2 is to succeed, such worlds as w 3 must not turn out to be the most similar worlds to w 0 where Nixon pressed the button.
error
checking: The lesson we learn by comparing w 1 and w 3 is that under the similarity relation we seek, close but approximate match of particular fact (especially if it is temporary) is not worth even a little miracle.
error
checking: Taking that and the previous lesson of w 2 together, we learn that perfect match of particular fact counts for much more than imperfect match, even if the imperfect match is good enough to give us similarity in respects that matter very much to us.
error
checking: I do not claim that this pre-eminence of perfect match is intuitively obvious.
20 syls
checking: I do not claim that it is a feature of the similarity relations most likely to guide our explicit judgments.
20 syls
checking: It is not; else the objection we are considering never would have been put forward.
18 syls
checking: (See also the opinion survey reported by Bennett in [2].
error
checking: ) But the pre-eminence of perfect match is a feature of some relations of overall similarity, and it must be a feature of any similarity relation that will meet our present needs.
19 syls
checking: A fourth class of candidates is typified by w 4 .
error
checking: This world begins like w 1 and w 3 .
error
checking: There is perfect match with w 0 until shortly before t, there is a tiny divergence miracle, the button is pressed.
error
checking: But there is a wide-spread and complicated and diverse second miracle after t. It not only prevents the holocaust but also removes all traces of Nixon's button-pressing.
19 syls
checking: The cover-up job is miraculously perfect.
13 syls
checking: Of course the fatal signal vanishes, just as at w 3 , but there is much more.
error
checking: The fingerprint vanishes, and the sweat returns to Nixon's fingertip.
19 syls
checking: Nixon's nerves are soothed, his memories are falsified, and so he feels no need of the extra martini.
18 syls
checking: The click on the tape is replaced by innocent noises.
14 syls
checking: The receding light waves cease to bear their incriminating images.
18 syls
checking: The wire cools down, and not by heating its surroundings in the ordinary way.
20 syls
checking: And so on, and on, and on.
7 syls
checking: Not only are there no traces that any human detective could read; in every detail of particular fact, however minute, it is just as if the button-pressing had never been.
18 syls
checking: The worlds end p.46 w 4 and w 0 reconverge.
error
checking: They are exactly alike again soon after t, and exactly alike forevermore.
19 syls
checking: All it takes is enough of a reconvergence miracle: one involving enough different sorts of violations of the laws of w 0 , in enough different places.
error
checking: Because there are many different sorts of traces to be removed, and because the traces spread out rapidly, the cover-up job divides into very many parts.
18 syls
checking: Each part requires a miracle at least on a par with the small miracle required to prevent the holocaust, or the one required to get the button pressed in the first place.
20 syls
checking: Different sorts of unlawful processes are needed to remove different sorts of traces: the miraculous vanishing of a pulse of current in a wire is not like the miraculous rearrangement of magnetized grains on a recording tape.
20 syls
checking: The big miracle required for perfect reconvergence consists of a multitude of little miracles, spread out and diverse.
error
checking: Such worlds as w 4 had better not turn out to be the most similar worlds to w 0 where Nixon pressed the button.
error
checking: The lesson we learn by comparing w 1 and w 4 is that under the similarity relation we seek, perfect match of particular fact even through the entire future is not worth a big, widespread, diverse miracle.
error
checking: Taking that and the lesson of w 2 together, we learn that avoidance of big miracles counts for much more than avoidance of little miracles.
error
checking: Miracles are not all equal.
8 syls
checking: The all-or-nothing distinction between worlds that do and that do not ever violate the laws of w 0 is not sensitive enough to meet our needs.
19 syls
checking: This completes our survey of the leading candidates.
14 syls
checking: There are other candidates, but they teach us nothing new.
14 syls
checking: There are some worlds where approximate reconvergence to w 0 is secured by a second small miracle before t, rather than afterward as at w 3 : Haig has seen fit to disconnect the button.
error
checking: Likewise there are worlds where a diverse and widespread miracle to permit perfect reconvergence takes place mostly before and during t: Nixon's fingers leave no prints, the tape recorder malfunctions, and so on.
18 syls
checking: Under the similarity relation we seek, w 1 must count as closer to w 0 than any of w 2 , w 3 , and w 4 .
error
checking: That means that a similarity relation that combines with Analysis 2 to give the correct truth conditions for counterfactuals such as the one we have considered, taken under the standard resolution of vagueness, must be governed by the following system of weights or priorities.
20 syls
checking: (1) It is of the first importance to avoid big, widespread, diverse violations of law.
error
checking: (2) It is of the second importance to maximize the spatio-temporal end p.47 region throughout which perfect match of particular fact prevails.
error
checking: (3) It is of the third importance to avoid even small, localized, simple violations of law.
error
checking: (4) It is of little or no importance to secure approximate similarity of particular fact, even in matters that concern us greatly.
error
checking: (It is a good question whether approximate similarities of particular fact should have little weight or none.
18 syls
checking: Different cases come out differently, and I would like to know why.
17 syls
added: Different cases come out differently, and I would like to know why.
checking: Tichý ([20]) and Jackson ([7]) give cases which appear to come out right under Analysis 2 only if approximate similarities count for nothing; but Morgenbesser has given a case, reported in Slote ([19]), which appears to go the other way.
error
checking: This problem was first brought to my attention by Ernest Loevinsohn.
error
checking: ) Plenty of unresolved vagueness remains, of course, even after we have distinguished the four sorts of respect of comparison and ranked them in decreasing order of importance.
18 syls
checking: But enough has been said to answer Fine's objection; and I think other versions of the future similarity objection may be answered in the same way.
19 syls
checking: The Asymmetry of Miracles Enough has been said, also, to explain why there is an asymmetry of counterfactual dependence in such a case as we have just considered.
19 syls
checking: If Nixon had pressed the button, the future would have been of the sort found at w 1 : a future very different, in matters of particular fact, from that of w 0 .
18 syls
checking: The past also would have been of the sort found at w 1 : a past exactly like that of w 0 until shortly before t. Whence came this asymmetry?
error
checking: It is not built into Analysis 2.
error
checking: It is not built into the standards of similarity that we have seen fit to combine with Analysis 2.
18 syls
checking: It came instead from an asymmetry in the range of candidates.
17 syls
added: It came instead from an asymmetry in the range of candidates.
checking: We considered worlds where a small miracle permitted divergence from w 0 .
18 syls
checking: We considered worlds where a small miracle permitted approximate convergence to w 0 and worlds where a big miracle permitted perfect convergence to w 0 .
18 syls
checking: But we did not consider any worlds where a small miracle permitted perfect convergence to w 0 .
19 syls
checking: If we had, our symmetric standards of similarity would have favored such worlds no less than w 1 .
error
checking: But are there any such worlds to consider?
11 syls
checking: What could they be like: end p.48 how could one small, localized, simple miracle possibly do all that needs doing?
error
checking: How could it deal with the fatal signal, the fingerprints, the memories, the tape, the light waves, and all the rest?
18 syls
checking: I put it to you that it can't be done!
11 syls
checking: Divergence from a world such as w 0 is easier than perfect convergence to it.
error
checking: Either takes a miracle, since w 0 is deterministic, but convergence takes very much more of a miracle.
error
checking: The asymmetry of counterfactual dependence arises because the appropriate standards of similarity, themselves symmetric, respond to this asymmetry of miracles.
error
checking: It might be otherwise if w 0 were a different sort of world.
error
checking: I do not mean to suggest that the asymmetry of divergence and convergence miracles holds necessary or universally.
18 syls
checking: For instance, consider a simple word inhabited by just one atom.
19 syls
checking: Consider the worlds that differ from it in a  certain way at a certain time.
19 syls
checking: You will doubtless conclude that convergence to this world takes no more of a varied and widespread miracle than divergence from it.
18 syls
checking: That means, if I am right, that no asymmetry of counterfactual dependence prevails at this world.
error
checking: Asymmetry-by-fiat analyses go wrong for such simple worlds.
18 syls
checking: The asymmetry of miracles, and hence of counterfactual dependence, rests on a feature of worlds like w 0 which very simple worlds cannot share.
error
checking: Asymmetry of Overdetermination Any particular fact about a deterministic world is predetermined throughout the past and postdetermined throughout the future.
error
checking: At any time, past or future, it has at least one determinant: a minimal set of conditions jointly sufficient, given the laws of nature, for the fact in question.
18 syls
checking: (Members of such a set may be causes of the fact, or traces of it, or neither.
18 syls
checking: ) The fact may have only one determinant at a given time, disregarding inessential differences in a way I shall not try to make precise.
20 syls
checking: Or it may have two or more essentially different determinants at a given time, each sufficient by itself.
18 syls
checking: If so, it is overdetermined at that time.
error
checking: Overdetermination is a matter of degree: there might be two determinants, or there might be very many more than two.
error
checking: I suggest that what makes convergence take so much more of a miracle than divergence, in the case of a world such as w 0 , is an asymmetry of overdetermination at such a world.
18 syls
checking: How much overdetermination of later affairs by earlier ones is there at our world, or at a deterministic world which might be ours for all we know?
error
checking: We have our stock examples—the victim whose heart is simultaneously pierced by two end p.49 bullets, and the like.
20 syls
checking: But those cases seem uncommon.
8 syls
checking: Moreover, the overdetermination is not very extreme.
error
checking: We have more than one determinant, but still not a very great number.
18 syls
checking: Extreme overdetermination of earlier affairs by later ones, on the other hand, may well be more or less universal at a world like ours.
error
checking: Whatever goes on leaves widespread and varied traces at future times.
17 syls
added: Whatever goes on leaves widespread and varied traces at future times.
checking: Most of these traces are so minute or so dispersed or so complicated that no human detective could ever read them; but no matter, so long as they exist.
19 syls
checking: It is plausible that very many simultaneous disjoint combinations of traces of any present fact are determinants thereof; there is no lawful way for the combination to have come about in the absence of the fact.
21 syls
checking: (Even if a trace could somehow have been faked, traces of the absence of the requisite means of fakery may be included with the trace itself to form a set jointly sufficient for the fact in question.
18 syls
checking: ) If so, the abundance of future traces makes for a like abundance of future determinants.
18 syls
checking: We may reasonably expect overdetermination toward the past on an altogether different scale from the occasional case of mild overdetermination toward the future.
error
checking: That would explain the asymmetry of miracles.
13 syls
checking: It takes a miracle to break the link between any determinant and that which it determines.
18 syls
checking: Consider our example.
8 syls
checking: To diverge from w 0 , a world where Nixon presses the button need only break the links whereby certain past conditions determine that he does not press it.
error
checking: To converge to w 0 , a world where Nixon presses the button must break the links whereby a varied multitude of future conditions vastly overdetermine that he does not press it.
error
checking: The more overdetermination, the more links need breaking and the more widespread and diverse must a miracle be if it is to break them all.
error
checking: An asymmetry noted by Popper ([16]) is a special case of the asymmetry of overdetermination.
error
checking: There are processes in which a spherical wave expands outward from a point source to infinity.
18 syls
checking: The opposite processes, in which a spherical wave contracts inward from infinity and is absorbed, would obey the laws of nature equally well.
18 syls
checking: But they never occur.

checking: A process of either sort exhibits extreme overdetermination in one direction.
error
checking: Countless tiny samples of the wave each determine what happens at the space-time point where the wave is emitted or absorbed.
18 syls
checking: The processes that occur are the ones in which this extreme overdetermination goes toward the past, not those in which it goes toward the future.
error
checking: I suggest that the same is true more generally.
13 syls
checking: Let me emphasize, once more, that the asymmetry of overdetermination is a contingent, de facto matter.
error
checking: Moreover, it may be a local  end p.50 matter, holding near here but not in remote parts of time and space.
error
checking: If so, then all that rests on it—the asymmetries of miracles, of counterfactual dependence, of causation and openness—may likewise be local and subject to exceptions.
18 syls
checking: I regret that I do not know how to connect the several asymmetries I have discussed and the famous asymmetry of entropy.

checking: Postscripts to " 'Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow" A. New Theory and Old?
error
checking: From time to time I have been told, much to my surprise, that this paper presents a "new theory" of counterfactuals, opposed to the "old theory" I had advanced in earlier writings.
19 syls
checking: 1 I would have thought, rather, that the truth of the matter was as follows.
error
checking: In the earlier writings I said that counterfactuals were governed in their truth conditions by comparative overall similarity of worlds, but that there was no one precisely fixed relation of similarity that governed all counterfactuals always.
error
checking: To the contrary, the governing similarity relation was both vague and context-dependent.
18 syls
checking: Different contexts would select different ranges of similarity relations, probably without ever reaching full determinacy.
19 syls
checking: In this paper I reiterate all that.
11 syls
checking: end p.52 Then I focus attention on some contexts in particular, and on the range of similarity relations that apply in such contexts.
error
checking: Thereby I add to my earlier discussion, but do not at all subtract from it.
19 syls
checking: Yet not a few readers think I have taken something back.
14 syls
checking: Why?
1 syls
checking: The trouble seems to be that a comparative relation of the sort that I now put forward—one that turns to some extent on the size of regions of perfect match, and to some extent on the scarcity in one world of events that violate the laws of another—is not at all what my earlier writings led these readers to expect.
18 syls
checking: But why not?
3 syls
checking: I think the trouble has three sources.
9 syls
checking: One source, I think, is entrenched doubt about the very idea of similarity.
22 syls
checking: It is widely thought that every shared property, in the most inclusive possible sense of that word, is prima facie a respect of similarity: that things can be similar in respect of satisfying the same miscellaneously  disjunctive formula, or in respect of belonging to the same utterly miscellaneous class.
19 syls
checking: If so, then there's little to be said about comparative similarity.
21 syls
checking: Any two things, be they two peas in a pod or be they a raven and a writing-desk, are alike in infinitely many respects and unlike in equally many.
18 syls
checking: Against this scepticism, I observed that we undeniably do make judgments of comparative overall similarity.
error
checking: And readers took the point—but in far too limited a way.
15 syls
checking: "Yes," I think they thought, "there is indeed a comparative relation that is special in the way it governs our explicit snap judgments.
18 syls
checking: We can scarcely doubt that—we have an operational test.
15 syls
checking: But leave that firm ground, and we're as much at sea as ever.
15 syls
checking: Apart from that one special case, we do not understand how one shared property can be more or less of a similarity-maker than another; or how it can be that some orderings are comparisons of similarity and others aren't".
20 syls
checking: And so I speak of similarity, and these sceptics understand me in the only way they can: they seize on the one discrimination they regard as unproblematic, since they can understand how to pick out one similarity relation operationally in terms of snap judgments.
error
checking: Then they observe, quite rightly, that the "similarity relation" I now put forward as governing counterfactuals isn't that one.
18 syls
checking: The right lesson would have been more far-reaching.
11 syls
checking: Our ability to make the snap judgment is one reason, among others, to reject the sceptical, egalitarian orthodoxy.
18 syls
checking: It just isn't so that all properties (in the most inclusive sense) are equally respects of similarity.
error
checking: Then it is by no means empty to say as I do that a relation of overall similarity is any weighted resultant of respects of similarity and dissimilarity.
18 syls
checking: (To end p.53 which I add that the weighting might be nonarchimedean; that is, we might have a system of priorities rather than trade-offs.
error
checking: ) Here we have a class of comparative relations that can go far beyond the one that governs the snap judgments; and that yet falls far short of the class delineated just by the formal character of comparative similarity.
19 syls
checking: Once we reject egalitarianism, what shall we put in its place?
18 syls
checking: An analysis, somehow, of the difference between those properties that are respects of similarity and those that aren't?
18 syls
checking: A primitive distinction?
7 syls
checking: A distinction built into our ontology, in the form of a denial of the very existence of the alleged properties that aren't respects of similarity?
18 syls
checking: A fair question; but one it is risky to take up, lest we put the onus on the wrong side.
19 syls
checking: What we know best on this subject, I think, is that egalitarianism is prima facie incredible.
20 syls
checking: We are entitled to reject it without owing any developed alternative.
18 syls
checking: 2 A second source of trouble, I suspect, is that some readers think of imperfect similarity always as imperfect match, and neglect the case of perfect match over a limited region.
error
checking: To illustrate, consider three locomotives: 2818, 4018, and 6018.
error
checking: 2818 and 4018 are alike in this way: they have duplicate boilers, smokeboxes, and fireboxes (to the extent that two of a kind from an early 20th century production line ever are duplicates), and various lesser fittings also are duplicated.
error
checking: But 2818 is a slow, small-wheeled, two-cylindered 2-8-0 coal hauler—plenty of pull, little speed—whereas 4018 is the opposite, a fast, large-wheeled, four-cylindered 4-6-0 express passenger locomotive.
error
checking: So is 6018; but 6018, unlike 2818, has few if any parts that duplicate the corresponding parts of 4018.
error
checking: (6018 is a scaled-up and modernized version of 4018.
error
checking: ) Anyone can see the way in which 6018 is more similar to 4018 than 2818 is.
error
checking: But I would insist that there is another way of comparing similarity, equally deserving of that name, on which the duplicate standard parts make 2818 the stronger candidate.
21 syls
checking: A third source of trouble may be a hasty step from similarity with respect to laws of nature to similarity of the laws—or, I might even say, to similarity of the linguistic codifications of laws.
18 syls
checking: Consider three worlds.
5 syls
checking: The first has some nice, elegant system of uniform laws.
15 syls
checking: The second does not: the best way to write down its laws would be to write end p.54 down the laws of the first world, then to mutilate them by sticking in clauses to permit various exceptions in an unprincipled fashion.
18 syls
checking: Yet almost everything that ever happens in the second world conforms perfectly to the laws of the first.
18 syls
checking: The third world does have a nice, elegant, uniform system; its laws resemble those of the first world except for a change of sign here, a switch  from inverse square to inverse cube there, and a few other such minor changes.
20 syls
checking: Consequently, the third world constantly violates the laws of the first; any little thing that goes on in the third would be prohibited by the laws of the first.
18 syls
checking: Focus on the linguistic codification of the laws, and it may well seem that the third world resembles the first with respect to laws far more than the second does.
18 syls
checking: But I would insist that there is another way of comparing similarity with respect to laws, equally deserving of that name, on which the second world resembles the first very well, and the third resembles the first very badly.
21 syls
checking: That is the way that neglects linguistic codifications, and looks instead at the classes of lawful and of outlawed events.
error
checking: B. Big and Little Miracles It has often been suggested, not often by well-wishers, that I should distinguish big and little miracles thus: big miracles are other-worldly events that break many of the laws that actually obtain, whereas little miracles break only a few laws.
19 syls
checking: I think this proposal is thoroughly misguided.
13 syls
checking: It is a good thing that I never endorsed it, and a bad thing that I am sometimes said to have endorsed it.
18 syls
checking: Consider two cases.
6 syls
checking: (1) By "laws" we might mean fundamental laws: those regularities that would come out as axioms in a system that was optimal among true systems in its combination of simplicity and strength.
error
checking: If the hopes of physics come true, there may be only a few of these fundamental laws altogether.
21 syls
checking: Then no miracle violates many fundamental laws; any miracle violates the Grand Unified Field equation, the Schrödinger equation, or another one of the very few, very sweeping fundamental laws.
20 syls
checking: Or (2) by "laws" we might rather mean fundamental or derived laws: those regularities that would come out as axioms or theorems in an optimal system.
error
checking: Then any miracle violates infinitely many laws; and again it doesn't seem that big miracles violate more laws than little ones.
19 syls
checking: It's a blind alley to count the violated laws.
14 syls
checking: What to do instead?
5 syls
checking: end p.55 Take the laws collectively; distinguish lawful events from unlawful ones.
error
checking: (For example, lawful pair-annihilations with radiation from unlawful quiet disappearings of single particles without a trace.
error
checking: ) In whatever way events can be spread out or localized, unlawful events can be spread out or localized.
18 syls
checking: In whatever way several events can be alike or varied, several unlawful events can be alike or varied.
18 syls
checking: In whatever way we can distinguish one simple event from many simple events, or from one complex event consisting of many simple parts, we can in particular distinguish one simple unlawful event from many, or from one complex event consisting of many simple unlawful parts.
18 syls
checking: A big miracle consists of many little miracles together, preferably not all alike.
18 syls
checking: What makes the big miracle more of a miracle is not that it breaks more laws; but that it is divisible into many and varied parts, any one of which is on a par with the little miracle.
18 syls
checking: C. Worlds to Which Convergence Is Easy Begin with our base world w 0 , the deterministic world something like our own.
20 syls
checking: Proceed to w 1 , the world which starts out just like w 0 , diverges from it by a small miracle, and thereafter evolves in accordance with the laws of w 0 .
error
checking: Now extrapolate the later part of w 1 backward in accordance with the laws of w 0 to obtain what I shall call a Bennett world.
error
checking: 3 This Bennett world is free of miracles, relative to w 0 .
error
checking: That is, it conforms perfectly to the laws of w 0 ; and it seems safe to suppose that these are the laws of the Bennett world also.
error
checking: From a certain time onward, the Bennett world and world w 1 match perfectly, which is to say that w 1 converges to the Bennett world.
error
checking: Further, this convergence is accomplished by a small miracle: namely, the very same small miracle whereby w 1 diverges from w 0 .
18 syls
checking: For we had already settled that this small divergence miracle was the only violation by w 1 of the laws of w 0 , and those are the same as the laws of the Bennett world.
18 syls
checking: Thus the Bennett world is a world to which convergence is easy, since w 1 converges to it by only a small miracle.
20 syls
checking: What then becomes of my asymmetry of miracles?
14 syls
checking: I said that end p.56 "divergence from such a world as w 0 is easier than perfect convergence to it.
error
checking: Either takes a miracle .
7 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: but convergence takes very much more of a miracle".
14 syls
checking: To be sure, I said that it might be otherwise for a different sort of world.
18 syls
checking: But the Bennett world seems to be a world of the same sort as w 0 .
18 syls
checking: After all, it has the very same laws.
10 syls
checking: No.
1 syls
checking: Same laws are not enough.
6 syls
checking: If there are de facto asymmetries of time, not written into the laws, they could be just what it takes to make the difference between a world to which the asymmetry of miracles applies and a world to which it does not; that is, between a world like w 0 (or ours) to which convergence is difficult and a Bennett world to which convergence is easy.
18 syls
checking: Consider, for instance, Popper's asymmetry.
13 syls
checking: 4 That is not a matter of law, so it could obtain in one and not the other of two worlds with exactly the same laws.
error
checking: Likewise in general for the asymmetry of overdetermination.
error
checking: A Bennett world is deceptive.
8 syls
checking: After the time of its convergence with w 1 , it contains exactly the same apparent traces of its past that w 1 does; and the traces to be found in w 1 are such as to record a past exactly like that of the base world w 0 .
error
checking: So the Bennett world is full of traces that seem to record a past like that of w 0 .
18 syls
checking: But the past of the Bennett world is not like the past of w 0 : under the laws that are common to both worlds, the past of the Bennett world predetermines that Nixon presses the button, whereas the past of w 0 predetermines that he does not.
error
checking: Further, we cannot suppose that the two pasts are even close.
15 syls
checking: As I noted in discussing world w 2 , there is no reason to think that two lawful histories can, before diverging, remain very close throughout a long initial segment of time.
error
checking: To constrain a history to be lawful in its own right, and to constrain it also to stay very close to a given lawful history for a long time and then swerve off, is to impose two very strong constraints.
19 syls
checking: There is not the slightest reason to think the two constraints are compatible.
19 syls
checking: To be sure, any complete cross section of the Bennett world, taken in full detail, is a truthful record of its past; because the Bennett world is lawful, and its laws are ex hypothesi deterministic (in both directions), and any complete cross section of such a world is lawfully sufficient for any other.
18 syls
checking: But in a world like w 0 , one that manifests the ordinary de facto asymmetries, we also have plenty of very incomplete cross sections that postdetermine incomplete cross sections at earlier times.
error
checking: It is these incomplete postdeterminants that are missing from end p.57 the Bennett world.
error
checking: Not throughout its history; but the postdetermination across the time of convergence with w 1 is deficient.
error
checking: Popper's pond is deceptive in just the same way.
13 syls
checking: Ripples rise around the edge; they contract inward and get higher; when they reach the center a stone flies out of the water—and then the pond is perfectly calm.
18 syls
checking: What has happened is the time-reversed mirror image of what ordinarily happens when a stone falls into a pond.
20 syls
checking: It is no less lawful; the violated asymmetries are not a matter of law.
18 syls
checking: There would be no feasible way to detect what had happened.
15 syls
checking: For there would be no trace on the water of its previous agitation; and the rock would be dry, the air would bear no sound of a splash, the nearby light would bear no tell-tale image, .
19 syls
checking: .

0 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: In short, a perfect cover-up job—and without any miracle!
17 syls
added: In short, a perfect cover-up job—and without any miracle!
checking: But not in a world like w 0 , and not in a world like ours.
error
checking: To be sure, if the laws are deterministic, the event is postdetermined by any complete cross section afterward.
error
checking: But we lack the usual abundance of lesser postdeterminants.
error
checking: D. The Indeterministic Case I assumed determinism for the sake of the argument.
error
checking: I considered the deterministic case in order to oppose the view that the asymmetries under consideration arise out of one-way indeterministic branching.
18 syls
checking: That is not to say, of course, that I assume determinism simpliciter.
error
checking: I. do not.
3 syls
checking: Accepted physics, after all, is not deterministic.
15 syls
checking: It is hard to know what to make of the indeterminism in present-day quantum mechanics.
error
checking: Pace Einstein, indeterminism per se is credible enough.
error
checking: But the  trouble is that the only indeterministic process in nature—reduction of the wave function, as opposed to Schrödinger evolution—is supposed to be special to the phenomenon of measurement.
error
checking: 5 And the end p.58 idea that a unique microphysical process takes place when a person makes a measurement seems about as credible as the idea that a unique kind of vibration takes place when two people fall truly in love.
error
checking: Instrumentalist philosophy among physicists doesn't help matters, though perhaps the quantum theory of measurement is such a disaster that it deserves to be dismissed as a mere instrument.
error
checking: Which parts of present theory are fact, which fiction?
12 syls
checking: What will remain when the dust settles?
9 syls
checking: I can only guess; my guess is not especially well informed; but for what it is worth, I guess as follows.
18 syls
checking: The theoretical foundation of quantum mechanics is probably wrong to say that reduction is brought on when people measure.
19 syls
checking: But the working quantum mechanics of radioactive decay, coherent solids, chemical bonding, and the like can somehow stand on its own.
20 syls
checking: It does not need this unfortunate anthropocentric foundation.
17 syls
added: It does not need this unfortunate anthropocentric foundation.
checking: 6 Then the laws of nature that govern our world really are indeterministic.
error
checking: Whatever we make of the reduction of the wave function supposedly brought on by measurement, at any rate there are chance processes involved in radioactive decay, in the making and breaking of chemical bonds, in ionization, in the radiation of light and heat, and so on.
19 syls
checking: These processes are pervasive.
8 syls
checking: So much so that not only is the world as a whole indeterministic, but also it can contain few if any deterministic enclaves.
error
checking: If so, then what becomes of my asymmetries?
12 syls
checking: In one way, the problem is easier.
10 syls
checking: Divergence no longer requires a small miracle, not if there are abundant opportunities for divergence in the outcomes of chance processes.
18 syls
checking: (If indeterministic processes were very scarce, miracles might still be required sometimes.
error
checking: But that is probably not the case for our world.
13 syls
checking: ) So in the indeterministic case it does not matter whether I am right to count small miracles as relatively cheap dissimilarities.
error
checking: Our divergences come cheaper still.
10 syls
checking: The thing to say about approximate convergence remains the same.
17 syls
added: The thing to say about approximate convergence remains the same.
checking: Even if approximate convergence is cheap—and even if it is cheaper still when it can be had without even a little miracle—still we can say that it counts for little or nothing, so it is not so that if Nixon had end p.59 pressed the button there would have been approximate convergence to our world, and no holocaust.
18 syls
checking: But what about perfect convergence?
9 syls
checking: Here, indeterminism makes my problem harder.
error
checking: It is not to be said that the similarity achieved by perfect convergence counts for little or nothing.
18 syls
checking: For it is just like the past similarity that has decisive weight in the deterministic case, tilting the balance in favor of last-minute divergence instead of difference throughout the past.
18 syls
checking: I said that perfect convergence would take a big, widespread, varied miracle—a miraculously perfect cover-up job.
19 syls
checking: But if chance processes are abundant, as I have guessed that they are, why couldn't they accomplish the cover-up?
18 syls
checking: Why couldn't convergence happen without any miracles at all, simply by the right pattern of lawful outcomes of many different chance processes?
error
checking: Call such a pattern a quasi-miracle.
11 syls
checking: It is extraordinarily improbable, no doubt, but it does not violate the laws of nature that prevail at our world.
18 syls
checking: What must be said, I think, is that a quasi-miracle to accomplish perfect convergence, though it is entirely lawful, nevertheless detracts from similarity in much the same way that a convergence miracle does.
18 syls
checking: That seems plausible enough.
7 syls
checking: (Though the test of the hypothesis is not in its offhand plausibility, but its success in yielding the right counter-factuals.
20 syls
checking: ) The quasi-miracle would be such a remarkable coincidence that it would be quite unlike the goings-on we take to be typical of our world.
18 syls
checking: Like a big genuine miracle, it makes a tremendous difference from our world.
18 syls
checking: Therefore it is not something that happens in the closest worlds to ours where Nixon presses the button.
18 syls
checking: These worlds have no convergence miracles, and also no convergence quasi-miracles.
19 syls
checking: So the case turns out as it should: the closest worlds where Nixon presses the button are worlds where a holocaust ensues.
18 syls
checking: My point is not that quasi-miracles detract from similarity because they are so very improbable.
18 syls
checking: They are; but ever so many unremarkable things that actually happen, and ever so many other things that might happen under various counterfactual suppositions, are likewise very improbable.
19 syls
checking: What makes a quasi-miracle is not improbability per se, but rather the remarkable way in which the chance outcomes seem to conspire to produce a pattern.
error
checking: If the monkey at the typewriter produces a 950-page dissertation on the varieties of anti-realism, that is at least somewhat quasimiraculous; the chance keystrokes happen to simulate the traces that would have been left by quite a different process.
error
checking: If the monkey instead types 950 pages of jumbled letters, that is not at all quasimiraculous.
error
checking: But, given suitable assumptions about what sort of chance device the monkey is, the one text is exactly as end p.60 improbable as the other.
18 syls
checking: (It is irrelevant to compare the probability that there will be some dissertation with the probability that there will be some jumble—the monkey does not just select one or the other kind of text, but also produces a particular text of the selected kind.
18 syls
checking: ) The pattern of systematic falsification of traces required for perfect convergence is quasi-miraculous in the same way.
19 syls
checking: (What if, contrary to what we believe, our own world is full of quasi-miracles?
19 syls
checking: Then otherworldly quasi-miracles would not make other worlds dissimilar to ours.
20 syls
checking: But if so, we would be very badly wrong about our world, so why should we not turn out to be wrong also about which counterfactuals it makes true?
18 syls
checking: I say that the case needn't worry us.
error
checking: Let it fall where it may.
6 syls
checking: ) In the deterministic case, the asymmetry of counterfactuals derives from an asymmetry of miracles: divergence takes less of a miracle than (perfect) convergence.
error
checking: Likewise in the indeterministic case we have an asymmetry of quasi-miracles.
error
checking: Convergence to an indeterministic world of the sort that ours might be takes a quasi-miracle; divergence from such a world does not.
error
checking: (I do not speak of small quasi-miracles; what corresponds to a small miracle in the deterministic case is a perfectly commonplace chance occurrence.
18 syls
checking: ) The asymmetry is made plausible by the same thought-experiment as before: think, in some detail and without neglecting imperceptible differences, of what would be needed for a perfect cover-up.
18 syls
checking: The trouble with using quasi-miracles as a weighty respect of dissimilarity is that it seems to prove too much, more than is true.
18 syls
checking: For if quasi-miracles make enough of a dissimilarity to outweigh perfect match throughout the future, and if I am right that counterfactuals work by similarity, then we can flatly say that if Nixon had pressed the button there would have been no quasi-miracle.
18 syls
checking: But if chance processes are abundant, and would have been likewise abundant if Nixon had pressed the button, then it that case there would have been some chance of a quasi-miracle.
19 syls
checking: To be sure, the probability would have been very low indeed.
17 syls
added: To be sure, the probability would have been very low indeed.
checking: But it would not have been zero.
8 syls
checking: But if there would have been some minute probability of a quasi-miracle, does it not follow that there might have been one?
18 syls
checking: And if there might have been one, then is it not false to say that there would not have been one?
18 syls
checking: True, it would have been overwhelmingly probable that there not be one.
18 syls
checking: But may we say flatly that this improbable thing would not have happened?
18 syls
checking: (Note that I am not talking about probabilities that certain counterfactuals are true.
error
checking: Rather, the consequents of the counterfactuals have to end p.61 do with probabilities.
error
checking: In particular, they have to do with objective single-case chances, as of the time right after the hypothetical pressing, of the patterns of events that would comprise a suitable quasi-miracle.
18 syls
checking: 7 ) Is there, perhaps, an exact balance?
error
checking: Suppose that perfect match throughout the future contributes to similarity exactly as much as the quasi-miracle needed to achieve that match detracts from similarity.
20 syls
checking: Then worlds with a quasi-miraculous convergence have no net advantage, and no net disadvantage.
19 syls
checking: Then they can be some, but not all, of the closest worlds where Nixon pressed the button.
18 syls
checking: That seems to give the right counterfactuals: it is not so that if he had pressed the button then there would have been quasi-miraculous convergence, and such convergence would not have been at all probable; but it is so that if Nixon had pressed the button then there might have been  quasi-miraculous convergence.
error
checking: So far, so good.
4 syls
checking: But this solution (besides seeming artificial) fails to solve the whole problem.
18 syls
checking: What about other quasi-miracles: patterns of outcomes of chance processes that are just as much remarkable coincidences, just as improbable, just as dissimilar from what typically goes on at our world—but do not yield convergence?
20 syls
checking: On the balance hypothesis, these non-convergence quasi-miracles detract greatly from similarity and bring no compensating gain.
18 syls
checking: So they, unlike the convergence quasi-miracles, are not to be found at any of the closest worlds where Nixon had pressed the button.
18 syls
checking: And that seems wrong.
4 syls
checking: It seems that we should say the same thing about any quasi-miracle, whether or not it yields convergence: if Nixon had pressed the button, it would have had some minute probability of happening, hence if so it might have happened, hence we should not say flatly that it would not have happened.
18 syls
checking: So the hypothesis of exact balance does not save the day and I am still in trouble.
18 syls
checking: The line of retreat, of course, is asymmetry by fiat.
15 syls
checking: Analysis 1, which drops the whole idea that counterfactuals work by similarity, is still available.
error
checking: It has no need of determinism.
10 syls
checking: Or we could complicate the weighting of respects of similarity so that perfect match in the past weighs heavily but perfect match in the future counts for nothing.
18 syls
checking: (More precisely: perfect match before and after the time relevant to the counterfactual supposition in question—as it might be, the time of Nixon's supposed pressing of the button.
18 syls
checking: ) Either way, we build an asymmetry between the directions of time into our very analysis: counterfactual, and hence on my view causal, dependence just consists end p.62 in part of temporal order.
18 syls
checking: I still say that won't do.
7 syls
added:  It has no need of determinism. I still say that won't do.
checking: It imposes a priori answers on questions that ought to be empirical.
error
checking: No; the asymmetry of counterfactual dependence should come from a symmetrical analysis and an asymmetrical world.
error
checking: What is to be done?
5 syls
checking: Our trouble was caused by an apparent logical connection between counterfactuals about what would happen, counterfactuals about what might happen, and counterfactuals about what the chances would be.
19 syls
checking: One escape route is to reconsider that connection.
14 syls
checking: Indeed, the connection seemed intuitively right, and I would be reluctant to challenge it just as a cure for my present trouble.
20 syls
checking: But it needs challenging also for other reasons.
13 syls
checking: Recall the problem.
5 syls
checking: By treating quasi-miracles as a weighty respect of dissimilarity, I make it turn out that there are no quasi-miracles of any kind, and hence there is no quasi-miraculous convergence, at any of the most similar worlds where Nixon pressed the button.
21 syls
checking: That means that: (1) If Nixon had pressed the button, there would not have been a quasi-miracle.
error
checking: But quasi-miracles are just certain special patterns of outcomes of chance processes, and the chances would have been much the same if Nixon had pressed the button.
18 syls
checking: That means that: (2) If Nixon had pressed the button, there would have been some minute chance of a quasimiracle.
error
checking: We had better accept both (1) and (2).
error
checking: But they seem to conflict.
6 syls
checking: Or do they?
3 syls
checking: Considered by themselves, there is no very clear impression of conflict.
18 syls
checking: Above, to create a semblance of conflict, I went in two steps, by way of: (3) If Nixon had pressed the button, there might have been a quasi-miracle.
18 syls
checking: Whether or not (1) and (2) conflict, it certainly seems that (1) and (3) conflict, and it also seems that (2) implies (3).
error
checking: But perhaps we are being fooled by an ambiguity in (3).
error
checking: I have hitherto advocated a "not-would-not" reading of "might" counterfactuals, on which (3) comes out as: (3-nwn) It is not the case that: if Nixon had pressed the button, there would not have been a quasi-miracle.
error
checking: end p.63 But perhaps there is also a "would-be-possible" reading, on which (3) comes out as: (3-wbp) If Nixon had pressed the button, it would be that: a quasi-miracle is possible.
error
checking: The readings differ as follows.
8 syls
added:  But they seem to conflict. Or do they? The readings differ as follows.
checking: (3-nwn) means that some of the most similar worlds where Nixon pressed the button are worlds where a quasi-miracle happens; whereas (3-wbp) means that all of them are worlds where it is possible for a quasi-miracle to happen.
error
checking: If all of them are worlds where there is an unfulfilled possibility of a quasi-miracle, that makes (3-nwn) false and (3-wbp)  true.
18 syls
checking: And if we take possibility to mean non-zero chance (as of the time of the pressing), then that is exactly the situation that makes (1) and (2) both true together.
18 syls
checking: Indeed, (1) conflicts with (3-nwn); indeed, (2) implies (3-wbp); but (1) and (2) are compatible.
error
checking: 8 I note that the same problem arises in consequence of my treatment of counterfactuals with true antecedents.
error
checking: Suppose that our world is an A-world with an unfulfilled non-zero chance of B. Then, since a counterfactual with a true antecedent is true iff its consequent is,9 we have a pair of true counterfactuals that parallel (1) and (2).
18 syls
checking: (4) If it were that A, then it would be that not B. (5) If it were that A, then there would be some chance that B. Thus (4) and (5), on my account, are compatible.
error
checking: Yet they may appear to conflict if we consider: (6) If it were that A, then it might be that B. This counterfactual seems to conflict with (4) and to be implied by (5).
error
checking: I reply that on the "not-would-not" reading (6) conflicts with (4) and is false, whereas on the "would-be-possible" reading it is implied by (5) and is true.
error
checking: end p.64 In fact, our problem is more far-reaching still.
error
checking: If we want any kind of similarity theory of counterfactuals, we dare not treat "there would be some chance of it" and "it would not happen" in general as incompatible.
error
checking: Suppose for reductio that counterfactuals of these two kinds are in general incompatible.
error
checking: Let C be any proposition that might obtain or not as a matter of chance; let u and v be a C-world and a not-C-world, respectively, but let them both be worlds that have a chance of going either way; let A be the proposition that holds at these two worlds, and no others; and let w be any third world.
19 syls
checking: It is true at w that if A, there would be some chance that C; so by the supposed incompatibility, it is false at w that if A, it would be that not-C; so u must be at least as close to w as v is.
18 syls
checking: Likewise, putting not-C in place of C, v must be at least as close to w as u is.
18 syls
checking: That is, worlds u and v are tied in closeness to any third world.
16 syls
checking: But u and v were any two worlds that differ in respect of the outcome of a matter of chance—no matter how much they may differ in other ways as well!
19 syls
checking: This completes the reduction.
7 syls
checking: 10 We can have a simpler reductio if we suppose that it is legitimate to mention chances in the antecedent of a counterfactual—and how can that fail to be legitimate, if chances are indeed an objective feature of the world?
error
checking: What would be the case if there were an unfulfilled chance of C?
15 syls
checking: If so, then there would be some chance that C. But if so, then also it would not be that C. So here we have a counterexample to the supposed incompatibility, just on the principle that a counterfactual holds when the antecedent implies the consequent.
18 syls
checking: So the supposed incompatibility had better be rejected.
18 syls
checking: The reconciliation of (1) with (2), (4) with (5), and the like is by no means just a dodge to defend my controversial views about time's arrow and about counterfactuals with true antecedents.
error
checking: But it does serve, inter alia, to defend them.
error
checking: We can count quasi-miracles as weighty dissimilarities from actuality; we can persuade ourselves by examples that perfect reconvergence to a world like ours would require, if not a big miracle, at least a quasi-miracle; we can conclude that if Nixon had pressed the button, there would have been no perfect convergence; and still we can say, as we should, that there would have been some minute chance of perfect convergence.
error
checking: end p.65 E. Ubiquitous Traces and Common Knowledge My argument for an asymmetry of miracles (or of quasi-miracles) relied on an empirical premise: at a world like ours, everything that happens leaves many and varied traces, so that it would take a big miracle—equivalently, many and varied small miracles working together—to eradicate those traces and achieve reconvergence.
error
checking: But I need more than merely the truth of that premise.
13 syls
checking: I need common knowledge of it.
8 syls
checking: For if the premise were true but generally disbelieved, and if our counterfactuals work as I say they do, then we ought to find people often accepting the counterfactuals that would be true on my account if that premise were false.
error
checking: We ought to find them  saying that if Nixon had pressed the button, the future would have been no different, there would have been convergence and no holocaust.
19 syls
checking: In illustrating the multitude of traces that the pressing would have left, and the difficulty of a perfect cover-up, I relied on a certain amount of scientific knowledge that many people do not share.
18 syls
checking: I may have explained why the right counterfactuals come out true according to my beliefs.
error
checking: But I have done nothing to explain why ignorant folk accept those same counterfactuals.
18 syls
checking: I reply that everyone believes in ubiquity of traces.
17 syls
added: I reply that everyone believes in ubiquity of traces.
checking: Maybe not everyone can illustrate the point in the way I did (though I must say that I did not use anything very esoteric) but they can still think that somehow everything leaves many and varied traces.
18 syls
checking: Consider detective stories.
8 syls
checking: Seldom are they written by, or for, expert scientists.
14 syls
checking: The background against which they are to be read is common knowledge, not expert knowledge.
19 syls
checking: And part of that background is the assumption that events leave many and varied traces.
18 syls
checking: Else the plots would not make sense.
7 syls
checking: We are supposed to marvel at the skill of the detective in spotting and reading the traces.
18 syls
checking: We are not supposed to marvel that the traces are there at all.
16 syls
checking: Ignorant or expert, anyone knows better than to read the tale as a hard-luck story: how the criminal was caught because he was especially unfortunate in leaving traces.
18 syls
checking: And anyone knows better than to read the tale as science fiction: how things would be in a bizarre world where things leave far more traces than they do in ours.
18 syls
checking: No; it is supposed to be a tale of a world like ours, and the ubiquity of traces is part of the likeness.
21 syls
checking: end p.66 Eighteen The Paradoxes of Time Travel Time travel, I maintain, is possible.
error
checking: The paradoxes of time travel are oddities, not impossibilities.
error
checking: They prove only this much, which few would have doubted: that a possible world where time travel took place would be a most strange world, different in fundamental ways from the world we think is ours.
18 syls
checking: I shall be concerned here with the sort of time travel that is recounted in science fiction.
18 syls
checking: Not all science fiction writers are clear-headed, to be sure, and inconsistent time travel stories have often been written.
20 syls
checking: But some writers have thought the problems through with great care, and their stories are perfectly consistent.
18 syls
checking: 1 If I can defend the consistency of some science fiction stories of time travel, then I suppose parallel defenses might be given of some controversial physical hypotheses, such as the hypothesis that time is circular or the hypothesis that there are particles that travel faster than light.
error
checking: But I shall not explore these parallels here.
11 syls
checking: What is time travel?
5 syls
checking: Inevitably, it involves a discrepancy between time and time.
18 syls
checking: Any traveler departs and then arrives at his destination; end p.67 the time elapsed from departure to arrival (positive, or perhaps zero) is the duration of the journey.
18 syls
checking: But if he is a time traveler, the separation in time between departure and arrival does not equal the duration of his journey.
18 syls
checking: He departs; he travels for an hour, let us say; then he arrives.
17 syls
added: He departs; he travels for an hour, let us say; then he arrives.
checking: The time he reaches is not the time one hour after his departure.
18 syls
checking: It is later, if he has traveled toward the future; earlier, if he has traveled toward the past.
18 syls
checking: If he has traveled far toward the past, it is earlier even than his departure.
18 syls
checking: How can it be that the same two events, his departure and his arrival, are separated by two unequal amounts of time?
19 syls
checking: It is tempting to reply that there must be two independent time dimensions; that for time travel to be possible, time must be not a line but a plane.
20 syls
checking: 2 Then a pair of events may have two unequal separations if they are separated more in one of the time dimensions than in the other.
error
checking: The lives of common people occupy straight diagonal lines across the plane of time, sloping at a rate of exactly one hour of time 1 per hour of time 2 .
18 syls
checking: The life of the time traveler occupies a bent path, of varying slope.
18 syls
checking: On closer inspection, however, this account seems not to give us time travel as we know it from the stories.
18 syls
checking: When the traveler revisits the days of his childhood, will his playmates be there to  meet him?
18 syls
checking: No; he has not reached the part of the plane of time where they are.
15 syls
checking: He is no longer separated from them along one of the two dimensions of time, but he is still separated from them along the other.
20 syls
checking: I do not say that two-dimensional time is impossible, or that there is no way to square it with the usual conception of what time travel would be like.
18 syls
checking: Nevertheless I shall say no more about two-dimensional time.
17 syls
added: Nevertheless I shall say no more about two-dimensional time.
checking: Let us set it aside, and see how time travel is possible even in one-dimensional time.
18 syls
checking: The world—the time traveler's world, or ours—is a four-dimensional manifold of events.
19 syls
checking: Time is one dimension of the four, like the spatial dimensions except that the prevailing laws of nature discriminate between time and the others—or rather, perhaps, between various timelike dimensions and various spacelike dimensions.
18 syls
checking: (Time remains one-dimensional, since no two timelike dimensions are orthogonal.
error
checking: ) Enduring things are timelike streaks: wholes composed of temporal parts, or stages, located at various times and places.
error
checking: Change is qualitative difference between different stages—different temporal parts—of some enduring thing, just as a "change" in scenery from east to west is end p.68 a qualitative difference between the eastern and western spatial parts of the landscape.
19 syls
checking: If this paper should change your mind about the possibility of time travel, there will be a difference of opinion between two different temporal parts of you, the stage that started reading and the subsequent stage that finishes.
18 syls
checking: If change is qualitative difference between temporal parts of something, then what doesn't have temporal parts can't change.
19 syls
checking: For instance, numbers can't change; nor can the events of any moment of time, since they cannot be subdivided into dissimilar temporal parts.
18 syls
checking: (We have set aside the case of two-dimensional time, and hence the possibility that an event might be momentary along one time dimension but divisible along the other.
22 syls
checking: ) It is essential to distinguish change from "Cambridge change," which can befall anything.
18 syls
checking: Even a number can "change" from being to not being the rate of exchange between pounds and dollars.
19 syls
checking: Even a momentary event can "change" from being a year ago to being a year and a day ago, or from being forgotten to being remembered.
18 syls
checking: But these are not genuine changes.
9 syls
checking: Not just any old reversal in truth value of a time-sensitive sentence about something makes a change in the thing itself.
18 syls
checking: A time traveler, like anyone else, is a streak through the manifold of space-time, a whole composed of stages located at various times and places.
18 syls
checking: But he is not a streak like other streaks.
10 syls
checking: If he travels toward the past he is a zig-zag streak, doubling back on himself.
18 syls
checking: If he travels toward the future, he is a stretched-out streak.
15 syls
checking: And if he travels either way instantaneously, so that there are no intermediate stages between the stage that departs and the stage that arrives and his journey has zero duration, then he is a broken streak.
18 syls
checking: I asked how it could be that the same two events were separated by two unequal amounts of time, and I set aside the reply that time might have two independent dimensions.
18 syls
checking: Instead I reply by distinguishing time itself, external time as I shall also call it, from the personal time of a particular time traveler: roughly, that which is measured by his wristwatch.
18 syls
processed: 1500
checking: His journey takes an hour of his personal time, let us say; his wristwatch reads an hour later at arrival than at departure.
19 syls
checking: But the arrival is more than an hour after the departure in external time, if he travels toward the future; or the arrival is before the departure in external time (or less than an hour after), if he travels toward the past.
18 syls
checking: That is only rough.
5 syls
checking: I do not wish to define personal time operationally, making wristwatches infallible by definition.
19 syls
checking: That which is measured by my own wristwatch often disagrees with external time, yet I am no time traveler; what my misregulated wristwatch measures end p.69 is neither time itself nor my personal time.
19 syls
checking: Instead of an operational definition, we need a functional definition of personal time: it is that which occupies a certain role in the pattern of events that comprise the time traveler's life.
19 syls
checking: If you take the stages of a common person, they manifest certain regularities with respect to external time.
18 syls
checking: Properties change continuously as you go along, for the most part, and in familiar ways.
18 syls
checking: First come infantile stages.
7 syls
checking: Last come senile ones.
5 syls
checking: Memories accumulate.
7 syls
checking: Food digests.
3 syls
checking: Hair grows.
2 syls
checking: Wristwatch hands move.
4 syls
checking: If you take the stages of a time traveler instead, they do not manifest the common regularities with respect to external time.
20 syls
checking: But there is one way to assign coordinates to the time traveler's stages, and one way only (apart from the arbitrary choice of a zero point), so that the regularities that hold with respect to this assignment match those that commonly hold with respect to external time.
18 syls
checking: With respect to the correct assignment properties change continuously as you go along, for the most part, and in familiar ways.
19 syls
checking: First come infantile stages.
7 syls
checking: Last come senile ones.
5 syls
checking: Memories accumulate.
7 syls
checking: Food digests.
3 syls
checking: Hair grows.
2 syls
checking: Wristwatch hands move.
4 syls
checking: The assignment of coordinates that yields this match is the time traveler's personal time.
19 syls
checking: It isn't really time, but it plays the role in his life that time plays in the life of a common person.
error
checking: It's enough like time so that we can—with due caution—transplant our temporal vocabulary to it in discussing his affairs.
18 syls
checking: We can say without contradiction, as the time traveler prepares to set out, "Soon he will be in the past".
18 syls
checking: We mean that a stage of him is slightly later in his personal time, but much earlier in external time, than the stage of him that is present as we say the sentence.
18 syls
checking: We may assign locations in the time traveler's personal time not only to his stages themselves but also to the events that go on around him.
18 syls
checking: Soon Caesar will die, long ago; that is, a stage slightly later in the time traveler's personal time than his present stage, but long ago in external time, is simultaneous with Caesar's death.
18 syls
checking: We could even extend the assignment of personal time to events that are not part of the time traveler's life, and not simultaneous with any of his stages.
18 syls
checking: If his funeral in ancient Egypt is separated from his death by three days of external time and his death is separated from his birth by three score years and ten of his personal time, then we may add the two intervals and say that his funeral follows his birth by three score years and ten and three days of extended personal time.
18 syls
checking: Likewise a bystander might truly say, three years after the last departure of another famous time traveler, that "he may even now—if I may use the phrase—be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted oolitic coral reef, or beside the end p.70 lonely saline seas of the Triassic Age".
19 syls
checking: 3 If the time traveler does wander on an oolitic coral reef three years after his departure in his personal time, then it is no mistake to say with respect to his extended personal time that the wandering is taking place "even now".
error
checking: We may liken intervals of external time to distances as the crow flies, and intervals of personal time to distances along a winding path.
18 syls
checking: The time traveler's life is like a mountain railway.
14 syls
checking: The place two miles due east of here may also be nine miles down the line, in the west-bound direction.
18 syls
checking: Clearly we are not dealing here with two independent dimensions.
17 syls
added: Clearly we are not dealing here with two independent dimensions.
checking: Just as distance along the railway is not a fourth spatial dimension, so a time traveler's personal time is not a second dimension of time.
18 syls
checking: How far down the line some place is depends on its location in threedimensional space, and likewise the location of events in personal time depend on their locations in one-dimensional external time.
error
checking: Five miles down the line from here is a place where the line goes under a trestle; two miles further is a place where the line goes over a trestle; these places are one and the same.
19 syls
checking: The trestle by which the line crosses over itself has two different locations along the line, five miles down from here and also seven.
18 syls
checking: In the same way, an event in a time traveler's life may have more than one location in his personal time.
18 syls
checking: If he doubles back toward the past, but not too far, he may be able to talk to himself.
18 syls
checking: The conversation involves two of his stages, separated in his personal time but simultaneous in external time.
18 syls
checking: The location of the conversation in personal time should be the location of the stage involved in it.
18 syls
checking: But there are two such stages; to share the locations of both, the conversation must be assigned two different locations in personal time.
20 syls
checking: The more we extend the assignment of personal time outwards from the time traveler's stages to the surrounding events, the more will such events acquire multiple locations.
18 syls
checking: It may happen also, as we have already seen, that events that are not simultaneous in external time will be assigned the same location in personal time—or rather, that at least one of the locations of one will be the same as at least one of the locations of the other.
18 syls
checking: So extension must not be carried too far,  lest the location of events in extended personal time lose its utility as a means of keeping track of their roles in the time traveler's history.
19 syls
checking: A time traveler who talks to himself, on the telephone perhaps, end p.71 looks for all the world like two different people talking to each other.
18 syls
checking: It isn't quite right to say that the whole of him is in two places at once, since neither of the two stages involved in the conversation is the whole of him, or even the whole of the part of him that is located at the (external) time of the conversation.
error
checking: What's true is that he, unlike the rest of us, has two different complete stages located at the same time at different places.
19 syls
checking: What reason have I, then, to regard him as one person and not two?
17 syls
added: What reason have I, then, to regard him as one person and not two?
checking: What unites his stages, including the simultaneous ones, into a single person?
18 syls
checking: The problem of personal identity is expecially acute if he is the sort of time traveler whose journeys are instantaneous, a broken streak consisting of several unconnected segments.
error
checking: Then the natural way to regard him as more than one person is to take each segment as a different person.
18 syls
checking: No one of them is a time traveler, and the peculiarity of the situation comes to this: all but one of these several people vanish into thin air, all but another one appear out of thin air, and there are remarkable resemblances between one at his appearance and another at his vanishing.
18 syls
checking: Why isn't that at least as good a description as the one I gave, on which the several segments are all parts of one time traveler?
error
checking: I answer that what unites the stages (or segments) of a time traveler is the same sort of mental, or mostly mental, continuity and connectedness that unites anyone else.
19 syls
checking: The only difference is that whereas a common person is connected and continuous with respect to external time, the time traveler is connected and continuous only with respect to his own personal time.
19 syls
checking: Taking the stages in order, mental (and bodily) change is mostly gradual rather than sudden, and at no point is there sudden change in too many different respects all at once.
18 syls
checking: (We can include position in external time among the respects we keep track of, if we like.
18 syls
checking: It may change discontinuously with respect to personal time if not too much else changes discontinuously along with it.
error
checking: ) Moreover, there is not too much change altogether.
13 syls
checking: Plenty of traits and traces last a lifetime.
11 syls
checking: Finally, the connectedness and the continuity are not accidental.
error
checking: They are explicable; and further, they are explained by the fact that the properties of each stage depend causally on those of the stages just before in personal time, the dependence being such as tends to keep things the same.
18 syls
checking: 4 To see the purpose of my final requirement of causal continuity, let end p.72 us see how it excludes a case of counterfeit time travel.
error
checking: Fred was created out of thin air, as if in the midst of life; he lived a while, then died.
18 syls
checking: He was created by a demon, and the demon had chosen at random what Fred was to be like at the moment of his creation.
19 syls
checking: Much later someone else, Sam, came to resemble Fred as he was when first created.
18 syls
checking: At the very moment when the resemblance became perfect, the demon destroyed Sam.
18 syls
checking: Fred and Sam together are very much like a single person: a time traveler whose personal time starts at Sam's birth, goes on to Sam's destruction and Fred's creation, and goes on from there to Fred's death.
18 syls
checking: Taken in this order, the stages of Fred-cum-Sam have the proper connectedness and continuity.
error
checking: But they lack causal continuity, so Fred-cum-Sam is not one person and not a time traveler.
19 syls
checking: Perhaps it was pure coincidence that Fred at his creation and Sam at his destruction were exactly alike; then the connectedness and continuity of Fred-cum-Sam across the crucial point are accidental.
18 syls
checking: Perhaps instead the demon remembered what Fred was like, guided Sam toward perfect resemblance, watched his progress, and destroyed him at the right moment.
19 syls
checking: Then the connectedness and continuity of Fred-cum-Sam has a causal explanation, but of the wrong sort.
error
checking: Either way, Fred's first stages do not depend causally for their properties on Sam's last stages.
error
checking: So the case of Fred and Sam is rightly disqualified as a case of personal identity and as a case of time travel.
18 syls
checking: We might expect that when a time traveler visits the past there will be reversals of causation.
18 syls
checking: You may punch his face before he leaves, causing his eye to blacken centuries ago.
19 syls
checking: Indeed, travel into the past necessarily involves reversed causation.
20 syls
checking: For time travel requires personal identity—he who arrives must be the same person who departed.
18 syls
checking: That requires causal  continuity, in which causation runs from earlier to later stages in the order of personal time.
18 syls
checking: But the orders of personal and external time disagree at some point, and there we have causation that runs from later to earlier stages in the order of external time.
18 syls
checking: Elsewhere I have given an analysis of causation in terms of chains of counterfactual dependence, and I took care that my analysis would not rule out causal reversal a priori.
18 syls
checking: 5 I think I can argue (but not here) that under my analysis the direction of counterfactual dependence and causation is governed by the direction of other de facto asymmetries of time.
error
checking: If so, then reversed causation and time travel are not excluded altogether, but can occur only where there are local exceptions to these end p.73 asymmetries.
21 syls
checking: As I said at the outset, the time traveler's world would be a most strange one.
18 syls
checking: Stranger still, if there are local—but only local—causal reversals, then there may also be causal loops: closed causal chains in which some of the causal links are normal in direction and others are reversed.
18 syls
checking: (Perhaps there must be loops if there is reversal; I am not sure.
16 syls
checking: ) Each event on the loop has a causal explanation, being caused by events elsewhere on the loop.
18 syls
checking: That is not to say that the loop as a whole is caused or explicable.
18 syls
checking: It may not be.
4 syls
checking: Its inexplicability is especially remarkable if it is made up of the sort of causal processes that transmit information.
error
checking: Recall the time traveler who talked to himself.
12 syls
checking: He talked to himself about time travel, and in the course of the conversation his older self told his younger self how to build a time machine.
20 syls
checking: That information was available in no other way.
15 syls
checking: His older self knew how because his younger self had been told and the information had been preserved by the causal processes that constitute recording, storage, and retrieval of memory traces.
21 syls
checking: His younger self knew, after the conversation, because his older self had known and the information had been preserved by the causal processes that constitute telling.
18 syls
checking: But where did the information come from in the first place?
14 syls
checking: Why did the whole affair happen?
8 syls
checking: There is simply no answer.
7 syls
checking: The parts of the loop are explicable, the whole of it is not.
16 syls
checking: Strange!
1 syls
checking: But not impossible, and not too different from inexplicabilities we are already inured to.
error
checking: Almost everyone agrees that God, or the Big Bang, or the entire infinite past of the universe or the decay of a tritium atom, is uncaused and inexplicable.
18 syls
checking: Then if these are possible, why not also the inexplicable causal loops that arise in time travel?
19 syls
checking: I have committed a circularity in order not to talk about too much at once, and this is a good place to set it right.
error
checking: In explaining personal time, I presupposed that we were entitled to regard certain stages as comprising a single person.
error
checking: Then in explaining what united the stages into a single person, I presupposed that we were given a personal time order for them.
19 syls
checking: The proper way to proceed is to define personhood and personal time simultaneously, as follows.
error
checking: Suppose given a pair of an aggregate of person-stages, regarded as a candidate for personhood, and an assignment of coordinates to those stages, regarded as a candidate for his personal time.
19 syls
checking: Iff the stages satisfy the conditions given in my circular explanation with respect to the assignment of coordinates, then both candidates succeed: the stages do comprise a person and the assignment is his personal time.
error
checking: I have argued so far that what goes on in a time travel story may be a end p.74 possible pattern of events in four-dimensional space-time with no extra time dimension; that it may be correct to regard the scattered stages of the alleged time traveler as comprising a single person; and that we may legitimately assign to those stages and their surroundings a personal time order that disagrees sometimes with their order in external time.
18 syls
checking: Some might concede all this, but protest that the impossibility of time travel is revealed after all when we ask not what the time traveler does, but what he could do.
18 syls
checking: Could a time traveler change the past?
9 syls
checking: It seems not: the events of a past moment could no more change than numbers could.
18 syls
checking: Yet it seems that he would be as able as anyone to do things that would change the past if he did them.
18 syls
checking: If a time traveler visiting the past both could and couldn't do something that would change it, then there cannot possibly be such a time traveler.
error
checking: Consider Tim.
4 syls
checking: He detests his grandfather, whose success in the munitions trade built the family fortune that paid for Tim's time machine.
error
checking: Tim would like nothing so much as to kill Grandfather, but alas he is too late.
18 syls
checking: Grandfather died in his bed in 1957, while Tim was a young  boy.
error
checking: But when Tim has built his time machine and traveled to 1920, suddenly he realizes that he is not too late after all.
error
checking: He buys a rifle; he spends long hours in target practice; he shadows Grandfather to learn the route of his daily walk to the munitions works; he rents a room along the route; and there he lurks, one winter day in 1921, rifle loaded, hate in his heart, as Grandfather walks closer, closer, .

6 syls
checking: He has what it takes.
5 syls
checking: Conditions are perfect in every way: the best rifle money could buy, Grandfather an easy target only twenty yards away, not a breeze, door securely locked against intruders, Tim a good shot to begin with and now at the peak of training, and so on.
18 syls
checking: What's to stop him?
5 syls
checking: The forces of logic will not stay his hand!
11 syls
checking: No powerful chaperone stands by to defend the past from interference.
19 syls
checking: (To imagine such a chaperone, as some authors do, is a boring evasion, not needed to make Tim's story consistent.
18 syls
checking: ) In short, Tim is as much able to kill Grandfather as anyone ever is to kill anyone.
19 syls
checking: Suppose that down the street another sniper, Tom, lurks waiting for another victim, Grandfather's partner.
19 syls
checking: Tom is not a time traveler, but otherwise he is just like Tim: same make of rifle, same murderous intent, same everything.
18 syls
checking: We can even suppose that Tom, like Tim, believes himself to be a time traveler.
18 syls
checking: Someone has gone to a lot of trouble to deceive Tom into thinking so.
18 syls
checking: There's no doubt that Tom can kill his victim; and Tim has everything going for him that Tom does.
19 syls
checking: By any ordinary standards of ability, Tim can kill Grandfather.
20 syls
checking: Tim cannot kill grandfather.
7 syls
checking: Grandfather lived, so to kill him end p.75 would be to change the past.
error
checking: But the events of a past moment are not subdivisible into temporal parts and therefore cannot change.
error
checking: Either the events of 1921 timelessly do include Tim's killing of Grandfather, or else they timelessly don't.
error
checking: We may be tempted to speak of the "original" 1921 that lies in Tim's personal past, many years before his birth, in which Grandfather lived; and of the "new" 1921 in which Tim now finds himself waiting in ambush to kill Grandfather.
error
checking: But if we do speak so, we merely confer two names on one thing.
16 syls
checking: The events of 1921 are doubly located in Tim's (extended) personal time, like the trestle on the railway, but the "original" 1921 and the "new" 1921 are one and the same.
error
checking: If Tim did not kill Grandfather in the "original" 1921, then if he does kill Grandfather in the "new" 1921, he must both kill and not kill Grandfather in 1921—in the one and only 1921, which is both the "new" and the "original" 1921.
error
checking: It is logically impossible that Tim should change the past by killing Grandfather in 1921.
18 syls
checking: So Tim cannot kill Grandfather.
8 syls
checking: Not that past moments are special; no more can anyone change the present or the future.
18 syls
checking: Present and future momentary events no more have temporal parts than past ones do.
18 syls
checking: You cannot change a present or future event from what it was originally to what it is after you change it.
21 syls
checking: What you can do is to change the present or the future from the unactualized way they would have been without some action of yours to the way they actually are.
error
checking: But that is not an actual change: not a difference between two successive actualities.
20 syls
checking: And Tim can certainly do as much; he changes the past from the unactualized way it would have been without him to the one and only way it actually is.
error
checking: To "change" the past in this way, Tim need not do anything momentous; it is enough just to be there, however unobtrusively.
18 syls
checking: You know, of course, roughly how the story of Tim must go on if it is to be consistent: he somehow fails.
18 syls
checking: Since Tim didn't kill Grandfather in the "original" 1921, consistency demands that neither does he kill Grandfather in the "new" 1921.
error
checking: Why not?
2 syls
checking: For some commonplace reason.
7 syls
added:  So Tim cannot kill Grandfather. Why not? For some commonplace reason.
checking: Perhaps some noise distracts him at the last moment, perhaps he misses despite all his target practice, perhaps his nerve fails, perhaps he even feels a pang of unaccustomed mercy.
19 syls
checking: His failure by no means proves that he was not really able to kill Grandfather.
20 syls
checking: We often try and fail to do what we are able to do.
15 syls
checking: Success at some tasks requires not only ability but also luck, and lack of luck is not a temporary lack of ability.
18 syls
checking: Suppose our other sniper, Tom, fails to kill Grandfather's partner for the same reason, whatever it is, that Tim fails to kill Grandfather.
18 syls
checking: It does not follow that Tom was unable to.
12 syls
checking: No more does it follow in Tim's case that he was unable to do what he did not succeed in doing.
18 syls
checking: end p.76  We have this seeming contradiction: "Tim doesn't, but can, because he has what it takes" versus "Tim doesn't, and can't, because it's logically impossible to change the past".
error
checking: I reply that there is no contradiction.
11 syls
checking: Both conclusions are true, and for the reasons given.
13 syls
checking: They are compatible because "can" is equivocal.
14 syls
checking: To say that something can happen means that its happening is compossible with certain facts.
error
checking: Which facts?
2 syls
checking: That is determined, but sometimes not determined well enough, by context.
18 syls
checking: An ape can't speak a human language—say, Finnish—but I can.
16 syls
checking: Facts about the anatomy and operation of the ape's larynx and nervous system are not compossible with his speaking Finnish.
19 syls
checking: The corresponding facts about my larynx and nervous system are compossible with my speaking Finnish.
error
checking: But don't take me along to Helsinki as your interpreter: I can't speak Finnish.
18 syls
checking: My speaking Finnish is compossible with the facts considered so far, but not with further facts about my lack of training.
error
checking: What I can do, relative to one set of facts, I cannot do, relative to another, more inclusive, set.
19 syls
checking: Whenever the context leaves it open which facts are to count as relevant, it is possible to equivocate about whether I can speak Finnish.
19 syls
checking: It is likewise possible to equivocate about whether it is possible for me to speak Finnish, or whether I am able to, or whether I have the ability or capacity or power or potentiality to.
18 syls
checking: Our many words for much the same thing are little help since they do not seem to correspond to different fixed delineations of the relevant facts.
18 syls
checking: Tim's killing Grandfather that day in 1921 is compossible with a fairly rich set of facts: the facts about his rifle, his skill and training, the unobstructed line of fire, the locked door and the absence of any chaperone to defend the past, and so on.
error
checking: Indeed it is compossible with all the facts of the sorts we would ordinarily count as relevant in saying what someone can do.
error
checking: It is compossible with all the facts corresponding to those we deem relevant in Tom's case.
error
checking: Relative to these facts, Tim can kill Grandfather.
12 syls
checking: But his killing Grandfather is not compossible with another, more inclusive set of facts.
error
checking: There is the simple fact that Grandfather was not killed.
13 syls
checking: Also there are various other facts about Grandfather's doings after 1921 and their effects: Grandfather begat Father in 1922 and Father begat Tim in 1949.
18 syls
checking: Relative to these facts, Tim cannot kill Grandfather.
13 syls
checking: He can and he can't, but under different delineations of the relevant facts.
error
checking: You can reasonably choose the narrower delineation, and say that he can; or the wider delineation, and say that he can't.
18 syls
checking: But choose.
2 syls
checking: What you mustn't do is waver, say in the same breath that he both can and can't, and then claim that this contradiction proves that time travel is impossible.
error
checking: end p.77 Exactly the same goes for Tom's parallel failure.
error
checking: For Tom to kill Grandfather's partner also is compossible with all facts of the sorts we ordinarily count as relevant, but not compossible with a larger set including, for instance, the fact that the intended victim lived until 1934.
error
checking: In Tom's case we are not puzzled.
9 syls
checking: We say without hesitation that he can do it, because we see at once that the facts that are not compossible with his success are facts about the future of the time in question and therefore not the sort of facts we count as relevant in saying what Tom can do.
18 syls
checking: In Tim's case it is harder to keep track of which facts are relevant.
18 syls
checking: We are accustomed to exclude facts about the future of the time in question, but to include some facts about its past.
18 syls
checking: Our standards do not apply unequivocally to the crucial facts in this special case: Tim's failure, Grandfather's survival, and his subsequent doings.
18 syls
checking: If we have foremost in mind that they lie in the external future of that moment in 1921 when Tim is almost ready to shoot, then we exclude them just as we exclude the parallel facts in Tom's case.
18 syls
checking: But if we have foremost in mind that they precede that moment in Tim's extended personal time, then we tend to include them.
18 syls
checking: To make the latter be foremost in your mind, I chose to tell Tim's story in the order of his personal time, rather than in the order of external time.
19 syls
checking: The fact of Grandfather's survival until 1957 had already been told before I got to the part of the story about Tim lurking in ambush to kill him in 1921.
error
checking: We must decide, if we can, whether to treat these personally past and externally future facts as if they were straightforwardly past or as if they were straightforwardly future.
18 syls
checking: Fatalists—the best of them—are philosophers who take facts we count as irrelevant in saying what someone can do, disguise them somehow as facts of a different sort that we count as relevant, and thereby argue that we can do less than we think—indeed, that there is nothing at all  that we don't do but can.
18 syls
checking: I am not going to vote Republican next fall.
13 syls
checking: The fatalist argues that, strange to say, I not only won't but can't; for my voting Republican is not compossible with the fact that it was true already in the year 1548 that I was not going to vote Republican 428 years later.
18 syls
checking: My rejoinder is that this is a fact, sure enough; however, it is an irrelevant fact about the future masquerading as a relevant fact about the past, and so should be left out of account in saying what, in any ordinary sense, I can do.
18 syls
checking: We are unlikely to be fooled by the fatalist's methods of disguise in this case, or other ordinary cases.
19 syls
checking: But in cases of time travel, precognition, or the like, we're on less familiar ground, so it may take less of a disguise to fool us.
error
checking: Also, new methods of disguise are available, thanks to the device of personal time.
18 syls
checking: end p.78 Here's another bit of fatalist trickery.
error
checking: Tim, as he lurks, already knows that he will fail.
12 syls
checking: At least he has the wherewithal to know it if he thinks, he knows it implicitly.
21 syls
checking: For he remembers that Grandfather was alive when he was a boy, he knows that those who are killed are thereafter not alive, he knows (let us suppose) that he is a time traveler who has reached the same 1921 that lies in his personal past, and he ought to understand—as we do—why a time traveler cannot change the past.
18 syls
checking: What is known cannot be false.
7 syls
checking: So his success is not only not compossible with facts that belong to the external future and his personal past, but also is not compossible with the present fact of his knowledge that he will fail.
error
checking: I reply that the fact of his foreknowledge, at the moment while he waits to shoot, is not a fact entirely about that moment.
error
checking: It may be divided into two parts.
10 syls
added:  What is known cannot be false. It may be divided into two parts.
checking: There is the fact that he then believes (perhaps only implicitly) that he will fail; and there is the further fact that his belief is correct, and correct not at all by accident, and hence qualifies as an item of knowledge.
18 syls
checking: It is only the latter fact that is not compossible with his success, but it is only the former that is entirely about the moment in question.
error
checking: In calling Tim's state at that moment knowledge, not just belief, facts about personally earlier but externally later moments were smuggled into consideration.
19 syls
checking: I have argued that Tim's case and Tom's are alike, except that in Tim's case we are more tempted than usual—and with reason—to opt for a semi-fatalist mode of speech.
18 syls
checking: But perhaps they differ in another way.
11 syls
checking: In Tom's case, we can expect a perfectly consistent answer to the counterfactual question: what if Tom had killed Grandfather's partner?
18 syls
checking: Tim's case is more difficult.
8 syls
checking: If Tim had killed Grandfather, it seems offhand that contradictions would have been true.
18 syls
checking: The killing both would and wouldn't have occurred.
error
checking: No Grandfather, no Father; no Father, no Tim; no Tim, no killing.
17 syls
added: No Grandfather, no Father; no Father, no Tim; no Tim, no killing.
checking: And for good measure: no Grandfather, no family fortune; no fortune, no time machine; no time machine, no killing.
18 syls
checking: So the supposition that Tim killed Grandfather seems impossible in more than the semi-fatalistic sense already granted.
18 syls
checking: If you suppose Tim to kill Grandfather and hold all the rest of his story fixed, of course you get a contradiction.
19 syls
checking: But likewise if you suppose Tom to kill Grandfather's partner and hold the rest of his story fixed—including the part that told of his failure—you get a contradiction.
18 syls
checking: If you make any counterfactual supposition and hold all else fixed you get a contradiction.
error
checking: The thing to do is rather to make the counterfactual supposition and hold all else as close to fixed as you consistently can.
error
checking: That procedure will yield perfectly consistent answers to end p.79 the question: what if Tim had not killed Grandfather?
error
checking: In that case, some of the story I told would not have been true.
15 syls
checking: Perhaps Tim might have been the time-traveling grandson of someone else.
17 syls
added: Perhaps Tim might have been the time-traveling grandson of someone else.
checking: Perhaps he might have been the grandson of a man killed in 1921 and miraculously resurrected.
error
checking: Perhaps he might have been not a time traveler at all, but rather someone created out of nothing in 1920 equipped with false memories of a personal past that never was.
19 syls
checking: It is hard to say what is the least revision of Tim's story to make it true that Tim kills Grandfather, but certainly the contradictory story in which the killing both does and doesn't occur is not the least revision.
18 syls
checking: Hence it is false (according to the unrevised story) that if Tim had killed Grandfather then contradictions would have been true.
18 syls
checking: What difference would it make if Tim travels in branching time?
15 syls
checking: Suppose that at the possible world of Tim's story the space-time manifold branches; the branches are separated not in  time, and not in space, but in some other way.
20 syls
checking: Tim travels not only in time but also from one branch to another.
18 syls
checking: In one branch Tim is absent from the events of 1921; Grandfather lives; Tim is born, grows up, and vanishes in his time machine.
error
checking: The other branch diverges from the first when Tim turns up in 1921; there Tim kills Grandfather and Grandfather leaves no descendants and no fortune; the events of the two branches differ more and more from that time on.
error
checking: Certainly this is a consistent story; it is a story in which Grandfather both is and isn't killed in 1921 (in the different branches); and it is a story in which Tim, by killing Grandfather, succeeds in preventing his own birth (in one of the branches).
18 syls
checking: But it is not a story in which Tim's killing of Grandfather both does occur and doesn't: it simply does, though it is located in one branch and not in the other.
18 syls
checking: And it is not a story in which Tim changes the past.
14 syls
checking: 1921 and later years contain the events of both branches, coexisting somehow without interaction.
error
checking: It remains true at all the personal times of Tim's life, even after the killing, that Grandfather lives in one branch and dies in the other.

19 syls
checking: Along with subjective credence we should believe also in objective chance.
18 syls
checking: The practice and the analysis of science require both concepts.
18 syls
checking: Neither can replace the other.
8 syls
checking: Among the propositions that deserve our credence we find, for instance, the proposition that (as a matter of contingent fact about our world) any tritium atom that now exists has a certain chance of decaying within a year.
19 syls
checking: Why should we subjectivists be less able than other folk to make sense of that?
error
checking: Carnap (1945) did well to distinguish two concepts of probability, insisting that both were legitimate and useful and that neither was at fault because it was not the other.
error
checking: I do not think Carnap chose quite the right two concepts, however.
error
checking: In place of his "degree of confirmation" I would put credence or degree of belief; in place of his "relative end p.83 frequency in the long run" I would put chance or propensity, understood as making sense in the single case.
19 syls
checking: The division of labor between the two concepts will be little changed by these replacements.
18 syls
checking: Credence is well suited to play the role of Carnap's probability 1 , and chance to play the role of probability 2 .
error
checking: Given two kinds of probability, credence and chance, we can have hybrid probabilities of probabilities.

9 syls
added:  Neither can replace the other. ) Chance of credence need not detain us.
checking: It may be partly a matter of chance what one comes to believe, but what of it?
18 syls
checking: Credence about chance is more important.
10 syls
checking: To the believer in chance, chance is a proper subject to have beliefs about.
18 syls
checking: Propositions about chance will enjoy various degrees of belief, and other propositions will be believed to various degrees conditionally upon them.
18 syls
checking: As I hope the following questionnaire will show, we have some very firm and definite opinions concerning reasonable credence about chance.
18 syls
checking: These opinions seem to me to afford the best grip we have on the concept of chance.

6 syls
checking: A certain coin is scheduled to be tossed at noon today.
14 syls
checking: You are sure that this chosen coin is fair: it has a 50% chance of falling heads and a 50% chance of falling tails.
error
checking: You have no other relevant information.
12 syls
checking: Consider the proposition that the coin tossed at noon today falls heads.
18 syls
checking: To what degree would you now believe that proposition?
14 syls
checking: Answer.
2 syls
checking: 50%, of course.
error
checking: (Two comments.
3 syls
checking: (1) It is abbreviation to speak of the coin as fair.
error
checking: Strictly speaking, what you are sure of is that the entire "chance set-up" is fair: coin, tosser, landing surface, air, and surroundings together are such as to make it so that the chance of heads is 50%.
18 syls
checking: (2) Is it reasonable to think of coin-tossing as a genuine chance process, given present-day scientific knowledge?
error
checking: I think so: consider, for instance, that air resistance depends partly on the chance making and breaking of chemical bonds between the coin and the air molecules it encounters.
18 syls
checking: What is less clear is that the toss could be designed so that you could reasonably be sure that the chance of heads is 50% exactly.
20 syls
checking: end p.84 If you doubt that such a toss could be designed, you may substitute an example involving radioactive decay.
error
checking: ) Next question.
3 syls
checking: As before, except that you have plenty of seemingly relevant evidence tending to lead you to expect that the coin will fall heads.
20 syls
checking: This coin is known to have a displaced center of mass, it has been tossed 100 times before with 86 heads, and many duplicates of it have been tossed thousands of times with about 90% heads.
error
checking: Yet you remain quite sure, despite all this evidence, that the chance of heads this time is 50%.
18 syls
checking: To what degree should you believe the proposition that the coin falls heads this time?
18 syls
checking: Answer.
2 syls
checking: Still 50%.
error
checking: Such evidence is relevant to the outcome by way of its relevance to the proposition that the chance of heads is 50%, not in any other way.
19 syls
checking: If the evidence somehow fails to diminish your certainty that the coin is fair, then it should have no effect on the distribution of credence about outcomes that accords with that certainty about chance.
18 syls
checking: To the extent that uncertainty about outcomes is based on certainty about their chances, it is a stable, resilient sort of uncertainty—new evidence won't get rid of it.
19 syls
checking: (The term "resiliency" comes from Skyrms (1977); see also Jeffrey (1965), §12.
error
checking: 5.

18 syls
checking: That may be so, but it doesn't matter.
error
checking: Canons of reasonable belief need not be counsels of perfection.
18 syls

18 syls
checking: Next question.

checking: As before, except that now it is afternoon and you have evidence that became available after the coin was tossed at noon.

checking: You remain as sure as ever that the chance of heads, just before noon, was 50%.
18 syls
checking: To what degree should you believe that the coin tossed at noon fell heads?

checking: The previous question gave examples of admissible evidence; this question gave examples of inadmissible evidence.
18 syls
checking: Last question.
3 syls
checking: You have no inadmissible evidence; if you have any relevant admissible evidence, it already has had its proper effect on your credence about the chance of heads.
19 syls
checking: But this  time, suppose you are not sure that the coin is fair.
14 syls
checking: You divide your belief among three alternative hypotheses about the chance of heads, as follows.
19 syls
checking: You believe to degree 27% that the chance of heads is 50%.
error
checking: You believe to degree 22% that the chance of heads is 35%.
error
checking: You believe to degree 51% that the chance of heads is 80%.
error
checking: Then to what degree should you believe that the coin falls heads?
14 syls
checking: Answer.
2 syls
checking: (27% × 50%) + (22% × 35%) + (51% × 80%); that is, 62%.
error
checking: Your degree of belief that the coin falls heads, conditionally on any one of the hypotheses about the chance of heads, should equal your unconditional degree of belief if you were sure of that hypothesis.
19 syls
checking: That in turn should equal the chance of heads according to the hypothesis: 50% for the first hypothesis, 35% for the second, and 80% for the third.
19 syls
checking: Given your degrees of belief that the coin falls heads, conditionally on the hypotheses, we need only apply the standard multiplicative and additive principles to obtain our answer.
18 syls
checking: The Principal Principle I have given undefended answers to my four questions.
error
checking: I hope you found them obviously right, so that you will be willing to take them as evidence for what follows.
18 syls
checking: If not, do please reconsider.
8 syls
checking: If so, splendid—now read on.
7 syls
checking: It is time to formulate a general principle to capture the intuitions that were forthcoming in our questionnaire.
18 syls
checking: It will resemble familiar principles of direct inference except that (1) it will concern chance, not some sort of actual or hypothetical frequency, and (2) it will incorporate the observation that certainty about chances—or conditionality on propositions about chances—makes for resilient degrees of belief about outcomes.
19 syls
checking: Since this principle seems to me to capture all we know about chance, I call it end p.86 THE PRINCIPAL PRINCIPLE.
18 syls
checking: Let C be any reasonable initial credence function.
16 syls
checking: Let t be any time.
6 syls
checking: Let x be any real number in the unit interval.
15 syls
checking: Let X be the proposition that the chance, at time t, of A's holding equals x. Let E be any proposition compatible with X that is admissible at time t. Then C (A/XE) = x. That will need a good deal of explaining.
19 syls
checking: But first I shall illustrate the principle by applying it to the cases in our questionnaire.
18 syls
checking: Suppose your present credence function is C(−/E), the function that comes from some reasonable initial credence function C by conditionalizing on your present total evidence E. Let t be the time of the toss, noon today, and let A be the proposition that the coin tossed today falls heads.
18 syls
checking: Let X be the proposition that the chance at noon (just before the toss) of heads is x. (In our questionnaire, we mostly considered the case that x is 50%).
18 syls
checking: Suppose that nothing in your total evidence E contradicts X; suppose also that it is not yet noon, and you have no foreknowledge of the outcome, so everything that is included in E is entirely admissible.
19 syls
checking: The conditions of the Principal Principle are met.
14 syls
checking: Therefore C(A/XE) equals x. That is to say that x is your present degree of belief that the coin falls heads, conditionally on the proposition that its chance of falling heads is x. If in addition you are sure that the chance of heads is x—that is, if C(X/E) is one—then it follows also that x is your present unconditional degree of belief that the coin falls heads.
error
checking: More generally, whether or not you are sure about the chance of heads, your unconditional degree of belief that the coin falls heads is given by summing over alternative hypotheses about chance: C(A/XE) = ΣxC(Xx/E) C(A/XxE) = ΣxC(Xx/E)x, where X x , for any value of x, is the proposition that the chance at t of A equals x. Several parts of the formulation of the Principal Principle call for explanation and comment.
18 syls
checking: Let us take them in turn.
6 syls
checking: The Initial Credence Function C I said: let C be any reasonable initial credence function.
20 syls
checking: By that I meant, in part, that C was to be a probability distribution over (at least) the space whose points are possible worlds and whose regions end p.87 (sets of worlds) are propositions.
21 syls
checking: C is a non-negative, normalized, finitely additive measure defined on all propositions.
error
checking: The corresponding conditional credence function is defined simply as a quotient of unconditional credences: C(A/B) =df C(AB)/C(B).
18 syls
checking: I should like to assume that it makes sense to conditionalize on any but the empty proposition.
error
checking: Therefore, I require that C is regular: C(B) is zero, and C(A/B) is undefined, only if B is the empty proposition, true at no worlds.
18 syls
checking: You may protest that there are too many alternative possible worlds to permit regularity.
18 syls
checking: But that is so only if we suppose, as I do not, that the values of the function C are restricted to the standard reals.
18 syls
checking: Many propositions must have infinitesimal Cvalues, and C(A/B) often will be defined as a quotient of infinitesimals, each infinitely close but not equal to zero.
error
checking: (See Bernstein and Wattenberg (1969).
error
checking: ) The assumption that C is regular will prove convenient, but it is not justified only as a convenience.
18 syls
checking: Also it is required as a condition of reasonableness: one who started out with an irregular credence function (and who then learned from experience by conditionalizing) would stubbornly refuse to believe some propositions no matter what the evidence in their favor.
18 syls
checking: In general, C is to be reasonable in the sense that if you started out with it as your initial credence function, and if you always learned from experience by conditionalizing on your total evidence, then no matter what course of experience you might undergo your beliefs would be reasonable for one who had undergone that course of experience.
18 syls
checking: I do not say what distinguishes a reasonable from an unreasonable credence function to arrive at after a given course of experience.
20 syls
checking: We do make the distinction, even if we cannot analyze it; and therefore I may appeal to it in saying what it means to require that C be a reasonable initial credence function.
18 syls
checking: I have assumed that the method of conditionalizing is one reasonable way to learn from experience, given the right initial credence function.
error
checking: I have not assumed something more controversial: that it is the only reasonable way.
18 syls
checking: The latter view may also be right (the cases where it seems wrong to conditionalize may all be cases where one departure from ideal rationality is needed to compensate for another) but I shall not need it here.
error
checking: (I said that C was to be a probability distribution over at least the space of worlds; the reason for that qualification is that sometimes one's credence might be divided between different possibilities within end p.88 a single world.
19 syls
checking: That is the case for someone who is sure what sort of world he lives in, but not at all sure who and when and where in the world he is.
18 syls
checking: In a fully general treatment of credence it would be well to replace the worlds by something like the "centered worlds" of Quine (1969), and the propositions by something corresponding to properties.
19 syls
checking: But I shall ignore these complications here.
11 syls
checking: ) The Real Number x I said: let x be any real number in the unit interval.
19 syls
checking: I must emphasize that "x" is a quantified variable; it is not a schematic letter that may freely be replaced by terms that designate real numbers in the unit interval.
18 syls
checking: For fixed A and t, "the chance, at t, of A's holding" is such a term; suppose we put it in for the variable x. It might seem that for suitable C and E we have the following: if X is the proposition that the chance, at t, of A's holding equals the chance, at t, of A's holding—in other words, if X is the necessary proposition—then  C(A/XE) = the chance, at t, of A’s holding.
18 syls
checking: But that is absurd.
5 syls
checking: It means that if E is your present total evidence and C(−/E) is your present credence function, then if the coin is in fact fair—whether or not you think it is!
18 syls
checking: —then your degree of belief that it falls heads is 50%.
error
checking: Fortunately, that absurdity is not an instance of the Principal Principle.
19 syls
checking: The term "the chance, at t, of A's holding" is a non-rigid designator; chance being a matter of contingent fact, it designates different numbers at different worlds.
error
checking: The context "the proposition that .
9 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: ", within which the variable "x" occurs, is intensional.
error
checking: Universal instantiation into an intensional context with a non-rigid term is a fallacy.
error
checking: It is the fallacy that takes you, for instance, from the true premise "For any number x, the proposition that x is nine is noncontingent" to the false conclusion "The proposition that the number of planets is nine is noncontingent".
18 syls
checking: See Jeffrey (1970) for discussion of this point in connection with a relative of the Principal Principle.
error
checking: I should note that the values of "x" are not restricted to the standard reals in the unit interval.
18 syls
checking: The Principal Principle may be applied as follows: you are sure that some spinner is fair, hence that it has infinitesimal chance of coming to rest at any particular point; therefore (if your total evidence is admissible) you should believe only to an infinitesimal degree that it will come to rest at any particular point.
18 syls
checking: end p.89 The Proposition X I said: let X be the proposition that the chance, at time t, of A's holding equals x. I emphasize that I am speaking of objective, single-case chance—not credence, not frequency.
error
checking: Like it or not, we have this concept.
9 syls
checking: We think that a coin about to be tossed has a certain chance of falling heads, or that a radioactive atom has a certain chance of decaying within the year, quite regardless of what anyone may believe about it and quite regardless of whether there are any other similar coins or atoms.
18 syls
checking: As philosophers we may well find the concept of objective chance troublesome, but that is no excuse to deny its existence, its legitimacy, or its indispensability.
20 syls
checking: If we can't understand it, so much the worse for us.
14 syls
checking: Chance and credence are distinct, but I don't say they are unrelated.
18 syls
checking: What is the Principal Principle but a statement of their relation?
18 syls
checking: Neither do I say that chance and frequency are unrelated, but they are distinct.
18 syls
checking: Suppose we have many coin-tosses with the same chance of heads (not zero or one) in each case.
18 syls
checking: Then there is some chance of getting any frequency of heads whatever; and hence some chance that the frequency and the uniform single-case chance of heads may differ, which could not be so if these were one and the same thing.
18 syls
checking: Indeed the chance of difference may be infinitesimal if there are infinitely many tosses, but that is still not zero.
18 syls
checking: Nor do hypothetical frequencies fare any better.
15 syls
checking: There is no such thing as the infinite sequence of outcomes, or the limiting frequency of heads, that would eventuate if some particular coin-toss were somehow repeated forever.
20 syls
checking: Rather there are countless sequences, and countless frequencies, that might eventuate and would have some chance (perhaps infinitesimal) of eventuating.
error
checking: (See Jeffrey (1977), Skyrms (1977), and the discussion of "might" counterfactuals in Lewis (1973).
error
checking: ) Chance is not the same thing as credence or frequency; this is not yet to deny that there might be some roundabout way to analyze chance in terms of credence or frequency.
18 syls
checking: I would only ask that no such analysis be accepted unless it is compatible with the Principal Principle.
18 syls
checking: We shall consider how this requirement bears on the prospects for an analysis of chance, but without settling the question of whether such an analysis is possible.
21 syls
checking: I think of chance as attaching in the first instance to propositions: the chance of an event, an outcome, etc.
18 syls
checking: is the chance of truth of the proposition that holds at just those worlds where that event, outcome, or whatnot occurs.
18 syls
checking: (Here I ignore the special usage of "event" to end p.90 simply mean "proposition".
error
checking: ) I have foremost in mind the chances of truth of propositions about localized matters of particular fact—a certain toss of a coin, the fate of a certain tritium atom on a certain day—but I do not say that those are the only propositions to which chance applies.
18 syls
checking: Not  only does it make sense to speak of the chance that a coin will fall heads on a particular occasion; equally it makes sense to speak of the chance of getting exactly seven heads in a particular sequence of eleven tosses.
18 syls
checking: It is only caution, not any definite reason to think otherwise, that stops me from assuming that chance of truth applies to any proposition whatever.
19 syls
checking: I shall assume, however, that the broad class of propositions to which chance of truth applies is closed under the Boolean operations of conjunction (intersection), disjunction (union), and negation (complementation).
18 syls
checking: We ordinarily think of chance as time-dependent, and I have made that dependence explicit.
18 syls
checking: Suppose you enter a labyrinth at 11:00 a.m., planning to choose your turn whenever you come to a branch point by tossing a coin.
error
checking: When you enter at 11:00, you may have a 42% chance of reaching the center by noon.
error
checking: But in the first half hour you may stray into a region from which it is hard to reach the center, so that by 11:30 your chance of reaching the center by noon has fallen to 26%.
18 syls
checking: But then you turn lucky; by 11:45 you are not far from the center and your chance of reaching it by noon is 78%.
error
checking: At 11:49 you reach the center; then and forevermore your chance of reaching it by noon is 100%.
error
checking: Sometimes, to be sure, we omit reference to a time.
14 syls
checking: I do not think this means that we have some timeless notion of chance.
16 syls
checking: Rather, we have other ways to fix the time than by specifying it explicitly.
18 syls
checking: In the case of the labyrinth we might well say (before, after, or during your exploration) that your chance of reaching the center by noon is 42%.
19 syls
checking: The understood time of reference is the time when your exploration begins.
18 syls
checking: Likewise we might speak simply of the chance of a certain atom's decaying within a certain year, meaning the chance at the beginning of that year.
20 syls
checking: In general, if A is the proposition that something or other takes place within a certain interval beginning at time t, then we may take a special interest in what I shall call the endpoint chance of A's holding: the chance at t, the beginning of the interval in question.
18 syls
checking: If we speak simply of the chance of A's holding, not mentioning a time, it is this endpoint chance—the chance at t of A's holding—that we are likely to mean.
18 syls
checking: Chance also is world-dependent.
8 syls
checking: Your chance at 11:00 of reaching the center of the labyrinth by noon depends on all sorts of contingent features of the world: the structure of the labyrinth and the speed with end p.91 which you can walk through it, for instance.
error
checking: Your chance at 11:30 of reaching the center by noon depends on these things, and also on where in the labyrinth you then are.
error
checking: Since these things vary from world to world, so does your chance (at either time) of reaching the center by noon.
18 syls
checking: Your chance at noon of reaching the center by noon is one at the worlds where you have reached the center; zero at all others, including those worlds where you do not explore the labyrinth at all, perhaps because you or it do not exist.
18 syls
checking: (Here I am speaking loosely, as if I believed that you and the labyrinth could inhabit several worlds at once.
19 syls
checking: See Lewis (1968) for the needed correction.
error
checking: ) We have decided this much about chance, at least: it is a function of three arguments.
18 syls
checking: To a proposition, a time, and a world it assigns a real number.
18 syls
checking: Fixing the proposition A, the time t, and the number x, we have our proposition X: it is the proposition that holds at all and only those worlds w such that this function assigns to A, t, and w the value x. This is the proposition that the chance, at t, of A's holding is x. The Admissible Proposition E I said: let E be any proposition that is admissible at time t. Admissible propositions are the sort of information whose impact on credence about outcomes comes entirely by way of credence about the chances of those outcomes.
18 syls
checking: Once the chances are given outright, conditionally or unconditionally, evidence bearing on them no longer matters.
21 syls
checking: (Once it is settled that the suspect fired the gun, the discovery of his fingerprint on the trigger adds nothing to the case against him.
18 syls
checking: ) The power of the Principal Principle depends entirely on how much is admissible.
18 syls
checking: If nothing is admissible it is vacuous.
13 syls
checking: If everything is admissible it is inconsistent.
15 syls
checking: Our questionnaire suggested that a great deal is admissible, but we saw examples also of inadmissible information.
18 syls
checking: I have no  definition of admissibility to offer, but must be content to suggest sufficient (or almost sufficient) conditions for admissibility.
18 syls
checking: I suggest that two different sorts of information are generally admissible.
19 syls
checking: The first sort is historical information.
12 syls
checking: If a proposition is entirely about matters of particular fact at times no later than t, then as a rule that proposition is admissible at t. Admissible information just before the toss of a coin, for example, includes the outcomes of all end p.92 previous tosses of that coin and others like it.
20 syls
checking: It also includes every detail—no matter how hard it might be to discover—of the structure of the coin, the tosser, other parts of the set-up, and even anything nearby that might somehow intervene.
18 syls
checking: It also includes a great deal of other information that is completely irrelevant to the outcome of the toss.
20 syls
checking: A proposition is about a subject matter—about history up to a certain time, for instance—if and only if that proposition holds at both or neither of any two worlds that match perfectly with respect to that subject matter.
18 syls
checking: (Or we can go the other way: two worlds match perfectly with respect to a subject matter if and only if every proposition about that subject matter holds at both or neither.
18 syls
checking: ) If our world and another are alike point for point, atom for atom, field for field, even spirit for spirit (if such there be) throughout the past and up until noon today, then any proposition that distinguishes the two cannot be entirely about the respects in which there is no difference.
19 syls
checking: It cannot be entirely about what goes on no later than noon today.
18 syls
checking: That is so even if its linguistic expression makes no overt mention of later times; we must beware lest information about the future is hidden in the predicates, as in "Fred was mortally wounded at 11:58".
19 syls
checking: I doubt that any linguistic test of aboutness will work without circular restrictions on the language used.
error
checking: Hence it seems best to take either "about" or "perfect match with respect to" as a primitive.
18 syls
checking: Time-dependent chance and time-dependent admissibility go together.
20 syls
checking: Suppose the proposition A is about matters of particular fact at some moment or interval t A , and suppose we are concerned with chance at time t. If t is later than t A , then A is admissible at t. The Principal Principle applies with A for E. If X is the proposition that the chance at t of A equals x, and if A and X are compatible, then 1 = C(A/XA) = x. Put contrapositively, this means that if the chance at t of A, according to X, is anything but one, then A and X are incompatible.
18 syls
checking: A implies that the chance at t of A, unless undefined, equals one.
18 syls
checking: What's past is no longer chancy.
9 syls
checking: The past, unlike the future, has no chance of being any other way than the way it actually is.
18 syls
checking: This temporal asymmetry of chance falls into place as part of our conception of the past as "fixed" and the future as "open"—whatever that may mean.
19 syls
checking: The asymmetry of fixity and of chance may be pictured by a tree.
error
checking: The single trunk is end p.93  the one possible past that has any present chance of being actual.
error
checking: The many branches are the many possible futures that have some present chance of being actual.
19 syls
checking: I shall not try to say here what features of the world justify our discriminatory attitude toward past and future possibilities, reflected for instance in the judgment that historical information is admissible and similar  information about the future is not.
18 syls
checking: But I think they are contingent features, subject to exception and absent altogether from some possible worlds.
19 syls
checking: That possibility calls into question my thesis that historical information is invariably admissible.
19 syls
checking: What if the commonplace de facto asymmetries between past and future break down?
19 syls
checking: If the past lies far in the future, as we are far to the west of ourselves, then it cannot simply be that propositions about the past are admissible and propositions about the future are not.
20 syls
checking: And if the past contains seers with foreknowledge of what chance will bring, or time travelers who have witnessed the outcome of coin-tosses to come, then patches of the past are enough tainted with futurity so that historical information about them may well seem inadmissible.
error
checking: That is why I qualified my claim that historical information is admissible, saying only that it is so "as a rule".
18 syls
checking: Perhaps it is fair to ignore this problem in building a case that the Principal Principle captures our common opinions about chance, since those opinions may rest on a naive faith that past and future cannot possibly get mixed up.
18 syls
checking: Any serious physicist, if he remains at least open-minded both about the shape of the cosmos and about the existence of chance processes, ought to do better.
18 syls
checking: But I shall not; I shall carry on as if historical information is admissible without exception.
19 syls
checking: Besides historical information, there is at least one other sort of admissible information: hypothetical information about chance itself.
18 syls
checking: end p.94 Let us return briefly to our questionnaire and add one further supposition to each case.
error
checking: Suppose you have various opinions about what the chance of heads would be under various hypotheses about the detailed nature and history of the chance set-up under consideration.
18 syls
checking: Suppose further that you have similar hypothetical opinions about other chance set-ups, past, present, and future.
18 syls
checking: (Assume that these opinions are consistent with your admissible historical information and your opinions about chance in the present case.
21 syls
checking: ) It seems quite clear to me—and I hope it does to you also—that these added opinions do not change anything.
19 syls
checking: The correct answers to the questionnaire are just as before.
15 syls
checking: The added opinions do not bear in any overly direct way on the future outcomes of chance processes.
18 syls
checking: Therefore they are admissible.
8 syls
checking: We must take care, though.
5 syls
checking: Some propositions about future chances do reveal inadmissible information about future history, and these are inadmissible.
19 syls
checking: Recall the case of the labyrinth: you enter at 11:00, choosing your turns by chance, and hope to reach the center by noon.
error
checking: Your subsequent chance of success depends on the point you have reached.
16 syls
checking: The proposition that at 11:30 your chance of success has fallen to 26% is not admissible information at 11:00; it is a giveaway about your bad luck in the first half hour.
error
checking: What is admissible at 11:00 is a conditional version: if you were to reach a certain point at 11:30, your chance of success would then be 26%.
error
processed: 2000
checking: But even some conditionals are tainted: for instance, any conditional that could yield inadmissible information about future chances by modus ponens from admissible historical propositions.
error
checking: Consider also the truth-functional conditional that if history up to 11:30 follows a certain course, then you will have a 98% chance of becoming a monkey's uncle before the year is out.
19 syls
checking: This conditional closely resembles the denial of its antecedent, and is inadmissible at 11:00 for the same reason.
20 syls
checking: I suggest that conditionals of the following sort, however, are admissible; and indeed admissible at all times.
error
checking: (1) The consequent is a proposition about chance at a certain time.
error
checking: (2) The antecedent is a proposition about history up to that time; and further, it is a complete proposition about history up to that time, so that it either implies or else is incompatible with any other proposition about history up to that time.
error
checking: It fully specifies a segment, up to the given time, of some possible course of history.
20 syls
checking: (3) The conditional is made from its consequent and antecedent not truthfunctionally, but rather by means of a strong conditional operation of some sort.
error
checking: This might well be the counterfactual conditional of Lewis (1973); but various rival versions would serve as well, since many differences do not matter for the case end p.95  at hand.
error
checking: One feature of my treatment will be needed, however: if the antecedent of one of our conditionals holds at a world, then both or neither of the conditional and its consequent hold there.
20 syls
checking: These admissible conditionals are propositions about how chance depends (or fails to depend) on history.
error
checking: They say nothing, however, about how history chances to go.
17 syls
added: They say nothing, however, about how history chances to go.
checking: A set of them is a theory about the way chance works.
14 syls
checking: It may or may not be a complete theory, a consistent theory, a systematic theory, or a credible theory.
18 syls
checking: It might be a miscellany of unrelated propositions about what the chances would be after various fully specified particular courses of events.
19 syls
checking: Or it might be systematic, compressible into generalizations to the effect that after any course of history with property J there would follow a chance distribution with property K. (For instance, it might say that any coin with a certain structure would be fair.
error
checking: ) These generalizations are universally quantified conditionals about single-case chance; if lawful, they are probabilistic laws in the sense of Railton (1978).
error
checking: (I shall not consider here what would make them lawful; but see Lewis (1973), §3.
error
checking: 3, for a treatment that could cover laws about chance along with other laws.
error
checking: ) Systematic theories of chance are the ones we can express in language, think about, and believe to substantial degrees.
18 syls
checking: But a reasonable initial credence function does not reject any possibility out of hand.
19 syls
checking: It assigns some nonzero credence to any consistent theory of chance, no matter how unsystematic and incompressible it is.
error
checking: Historical propositions are admissible; so are propositions about the dependence of chance on history.
19 syls
checking: Combinations of the two, of course, are also admissible.
16 syls
checking: More generally, we may assume that any Boolean combination of propositions admissible at a time also is admissible at that time.
19 syls
checking: Admissibility consists in keeping out of a forbidden subject matter—how the chance processes turned out—and there is no way to break into a subject matter by making Boolean combinations of propositions that lie outside it.
19 syls
checking: There may be sorts of admissible propositions besides those I have considered.
18 syls
checking: If so, we shall have no need of them in what follows.
13 syls
checking: This completes an exposition of the Principal Principle.
16 syls
checking: We turn next to an examination of its consequences.
16 syls
checking: I maintain that they include all that we take ourselves to know about chance.
18 syls
checking: The Principle Reformulated Given a time t and world w, let us write P tw for the chance distribution that obtains at t and w. For any proposition A, P tw (A) is the chance, at end p.96 time t and world w, of A's holding.
19 syls
checking: (The domain of P tw comprises those propositions for which this chance is defined.
error
checking: ) Let us also write H tw for the complete history of world w up to time t: the conjunction of all propositions that hold at w about matters of particular fact no later than t. H tw is the proposition that holds at exactly those worlds that perfectly match w, in matters of particular fact, up to time t. Let us also write T w for the complete theory of chance for world w: the conjunction of all the conditionals from history to chance, of the sort just considered, that hold at w. Thus T w is a full specification, for world w, of the way chances at any time depend on history up to that time.
error
checking: Taking the conjunction H tw T w , we have a proposition that tells us a great deal about the world w. It is nevertheless admissible at time t, being simply a giant conjunction of historical propositions that are admissible at t and conditionals from history to chance that are admissible at any time.
error
checking: Hence the Principal Principle applies: C(A/XHtwTw) = x when C is a reasonable initial credence function, X is the proposition that the chance at t of A is x, and H tw T w is compatible with X. Suppose X holds at w. That is so if and only if x equals P tw (A).
error
checking: Hence we can choose such an X whenever A is in the domain of P tw .
18 syls
checking: H tw T w and X both hold at w, therefore they are compatible.
error
checking: But further, H tw T w implies X. The theory T w and the history H tw together are enough  to imply all that is true (and contradict all that is false) at world w about chances at time t. For consider the strong conditional with antecedent H tw and consequent X. This conditional holds at w, since by hypothesis its antecedent and consequent hold there.
error
checking: Hence it is implied by T w , which is the conjunction of all conditionals of its sort that hold at w; and this conditional and H tw yield X by modus ponens.
18 syls
checking: Consequently, the conjunction XH tw T w simplifies to H tw T w .
error
checking: Provided that A is in the domain of P tw so that we can make a suitable choice of X, we can substitute P tw (A) for x, and H tw T w for XH tw T w , in our instance of the Principal Principle.

error
checking: It obeys the laws of mathematical probability theory.
18 syls
checking: There are well-known reasons why that must be so if credence is to rationalize courses of action that would not seem blatantly unreasonable in some circumstances.

error
checking: Therefore a chance distribution is a probability distribution.
19 syls

checking: Chance as Objectified Credence Chance is an objectified subjective probability in the sense of Jeffrey (1965), §12.
error
checking: 7.
error
checking: Jeffrey's construction (omitting his use of sequences of partitions, which is unnecessary if we allow infinitestimal credences) works as follows.
19 syls
checking: Suppose given a partition of logical space: a set of mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive propositions.
20 syls
checking: Then we can define the objectification of a credence function, with respect to this end p.98 partition, at a certain world, as the probability distribution that comes from the given credence function by conditionalizing on the member of the given partition that holds at the given world.
error
checking: Objectified credence is credence conditional on the truth—not the whole truth, however, but exactly as much of it as can be captured by a member of the partition without further subdivision of logical space.
error
checking: The member of the partition that holds depends on matters of contingent fact, varying from one world to another; it does not depend on what we think (except insofar as our thoughts are relevant matters of fact) and we may well be ignorant or mistaken about it.
19 syls
checking: The same goes for objectified credence.
error
checking: Now consider one particular way of partitioning.
15 syls
checking: For any time t, consider the partition consisting of the propositions H tw T w for all worlds w. Call this the history-theory partition for time   t. A member of this partition is an equivalence class of worlds with respect to the relation of being exactly alike both in respect of matters of particular fact up to time t and in respect of the dependence of chance on history.
21 syls
checking: The Principal Principle tells us that the chance distribution, at any time t and world w, is the objectification of any reasonable credence function, with respect to the history-theory partition for time t, at world w. Chance is credence conditional on the truth—if the truth is subject to censorship along the lines of the history-theory partition, and if the credence is reasonable.
19 syls
checking: Any historical proposition admissible at time t, or any admissible conditional from history to chance, or any admissible Boolean combination of propositions of these two kinds—in short, any sort of admissible proposition we have considered—is a disjunction of members of the historytheory partition for t. Its borders follow the lines of the partition, never cutting between two worlds that the partition does not distinguish.
18 syls
checking: Likewise for any proposition about chances at t. Let X be the proposition that the chance at t of A is x, let Y be any member of the history-theory partition for t, and let C be any reasonable initial credence function.
18 syls
checking: Then, according to our reformulation of the Principal Principle, X holds at all worlds in Y if C(A/Y) equals x, and at no worlds in Y otherwise.
error
checking: Therefore X is the disjunction of all members Y of the partition such that C(A/Y) equals x. We may picture the situation as follows.
error
checking: The partition divides logical space into countless tiny squares.
17 syls
added: The partition divides logical space into countless tiny squares.
checking: In each square there is a black region where A holds and a white region where it does not.
18 syls
checking: Now blur the focus, so that divisions within the squares disappear from view.
18 syls
checking: Each square becomes a grey patch in a broad expanse covered with varying end p.99 shades of grey.
18 syls
checking: Any maximal region of uniform shade is a proposition specifying the chance of A. The darker the shade, the higher is the uniform chance of A at the worlds in the region.
18 syls
checking: The worlds themselves are not grey—they are black or white, worlds where A holds or where it doesn't—but we cannot focus on single worlds, so they all seem to be the shade of grey that covers their region.
18 syls
checking: Admissible propositions, of the sorts we have considered, are regions that may cut across the contours of the shades of grey.
19 syls
checking: The conjunction of one of these admissible propositions and a proposition about the chance of A is a region of uniform shade, but not in general a maximal uniform region.
18 syls
checking: It consists of some, but perhaps not all, the members Y of the partition for which C(A/Y) takes a certain value.
19 syls
checking: We derived our reformulation of the Principal Principle from the original formulation, but have not given a reverse derivation to show the two formulations equivalent.
error
checking: In fact the reformulation may be weaker, but not in any way that is likely to matter.
error
checking: Let C be a reasonable initial credence function; let X be the proposition that the chance at t of A is x; let E be admissible at t (in one of the ways we have considered) and compatible with X. According to the reformulation, as we have seen, XE is a disjunction of incompatible propositions Y, for each of which C(A/Y) equals x. If there were only finitely many Y's, it would follow that C(A/XE) also equals x. But the implication fails in certain cases with infinitely many Y's (and indeed we would expect the historytheory partition to be infinite) so we cannot quite recover the original formulation in this way.
18 syls
checking: The cases of failure are peculiar, however, so the extra strength of the original formulation in ruling them out seems unimportant.
18 syls
checking: Kinematics of Chance Chance being a kind of probability, we may define conditional chance in the usual way as a quotient (leaving it undefined if the denominator is zero): Ptw(A/B) = df Ptw(AB)/Ptw(B).
error
checking: To simplify notation, let us fix on a particular world—ours, as it might be—and omit the subscript "w"; let us fix on some particular reasonable initial credence function C, it doesn't matter which; and let us fix on a sequence of times, in order from earlier to later, to be called 1, 2, 3, .

19 syls
checking: Suppose all these conditionals have the same consequent: whichever one of the alternative histories were to come about, it would be that X, where X is the proposition that the chance at 2 of A 2 equals x. Then the conditionals taken together tell us that the endpoint chance of A 2 is independent of all aspects of the history of the first interval except the outcome of the first toss.
error
checking: In that case we can equate the conditional chance P 1 (A 2 /A 1 ) and the endpoint chance P 2 (A 2 ).
error
checking: Note that our conditionals are of the sort implied by T, the complete theory of chance for our chosen world.

error
checking: We argue as before, leaving out A 1 : T implies the conditionals, H 1  and T jointly imply X, H 1 T and XH 1 T are the same, X holds, x equals P 2 (A 2 ), H 1 T is admissible at 2; so, using the Principal Principle in both formulations, we have P1(A2) = C(A2/H1T) = C(A2/XH1T) = x = P2(A2).
error

19 syls
checking: Two conceptions of independence are in play together.
15 syls
checking: One is the familiar probabilistic conception: A 2 is independent of A 1 , with respect to the chance distribution P 1 , if the conditional chance P 1 (A 2 /A 1 ) equals the unconditional chance P 1 (A 2 ); equivalently, if the chance P 1 (A 1 A 2 ) of the conjunction equals the product P 1 (A 1 )· P 1 (A 2 ) of the chances of the conjuncts.
error
checking: The other conception involves batteries of strong conditionals with different antecedents and the same consequent.
error
checking: (I consider this to be causal independence, but that's another story.

error

20 syls
checking: If the world is right, the situation might be still simpler; and this is the case we hope to achieve in a well-conducted sequence of chance trials.
18 syls
checking: Suppose the history-to-chance conditionals and the previous history of our chosen world give us not only independence (of the stronger sort) but also uniformity of chances: for any toss in our sequence, the endpoint chance of heads on that toss would be h (and the endpoint chance of tails would be 1 − h) no matter which of the possible previous histories compatible with H 1 might have come to pass.
error

20 syls

checking: ) Suppose that at time 1 your credence function is C(−/E), the function that comes from our chosen reasonable initial credence function C by conditionalizing on your total evidence E up to that time.
error
checking: Then if you learn from experience by conditionalizing, your credence function after the experiment is (C−/FE).
error
checking: The impact of your experimental evidence F on your beliefs, about chances or anything else, is given by the difference between these two functions.
18 syls
checking: Suppose that before the experiment your credence is distributed over a range of alternative hypotheses about the endpoint chances of heads in the experimental tosses.
18 syls
checking: (Your degree of belief that none of these hypotheses is correct may not be zero, but I am supposing it to be negligible and shall accordingly neglect it.
18 syls
checking: ) The hypotheses agree that these chances are uniform, and each independent of the previous course of history after time 1; but they disagree about what the uniform chance of heads is.
21 syls
checking: Let us write G h for the hypothesis that the endpoint chances of heads are uniformly h. Then the credences C(G h /E), for various h's, comprise the prior distribution of credence over the hypotheses; the credences C(G h /FE) comprise the posterior distribution; and the credences C(F/G h E) are the likelihoods.
18 syls
checking: Bayes' Theorem gives the posterior distribution in terms of the prior distribution and the likelihoods: C(Gh/FE) = C(Gh/E) · C(F/GhE) ∑h [C(Gh/E) · C(F/GhE)] (Note that "h" is a bound variable of summation in the denominator of the right hand side, but a free variable elsewhere.
19 syls

19 syls
checking: In talking only about a single experiment, there is little to say about the prior distribution.
18 syls
checking: That does indeed depend on the vagaries of initial credence and previous evidence.
18 syls
checking: Not so for the likelihoods.
error
checking: As we saw in the last section, each G h implies a proposition X h to the effect that the chance at 1 of F equals x h , where x h is given by a certain function of h, n, and f. Hence G h E and X h G h E are the same proposition.
18 syls
checking: Further, G h E and X are compatible (unless G h E is itself impossible, in which case G h might as well be omitted from the range of hypotheses).
18 syls
checking: E is admissible at 1, being about matters of particular fact—your evidence—at times no later than 1.
error
checking: G h also is admissible at 1.
error
checking: Recall from the last section that what end p.107 makes such a proposition hold at a world is a certain relationship between that world's complete history up to time 1 and that world's history-to-chance conditionals about the chances that would follow various complete extensions of that history.
error
checking: Hence any member of the history-theory partition for time 1 either implies or contradicts G h ; G h is therefore a disjunction of conjunctions of admissible historical propositions and admissible history-to-chance conditionals.
error
checking: Finally, we supposed that C is reasonable.
13 syls
checking: So the Principal Principle applies: C(F/GhE) = C(F/XhGhE) = xh.
error
checking: The likelihoods are the endpoint chances, according to the various hypotheses, of obtaining the frequency of heads that was in fact obtained.
error
checking: When we carry the calculation through, putting these implied chances for the likelihoods in Bayes' theorem, the results are as we would expect.
18 syls
checking: An observed frequency of f raises the credences of the hypotheses G h with h close to f at the expense of the others; the more sharply so, the greater is the number of tosses.
error
checking: Unless the prior distribution is irremediably biased, the result after enough tosses is that the lion's share of the posterior credence will go to hypotheses putting the single-case chance of heads close to the observed frequency.

17 syls
added: There is no great puzzle about why credence should be a guide to life.
checking: Roughly speaking, what makes it be so that a certain credence function is your credence function is the very fact that you are disposed to act in more or less the ways that it rationalizes.
18 syls
checking: (Better: what makes it be so that a certain reasonable initial credence function and a certain reasonable system of basic intrinsic values are both yours is that you are disposed to act in more or less the ways that are rationalized by the pair of them together, taking into account the modification of credence by conditionalizing on total evidence; and further, you would have been likewise disposed if your life history of experience, and consequent end p.108 modification of credence, had been different; and further, no other such pair would fit your dispositions more closely.
18 syls
checking: ) No wonder your credence function tends to guide your life.
13 syls
checking: If its doing so did not accord to some considerable extent with your dispositions to act, then it would not be your credence function.
18 syls
checking: You would have some other credence function, or none.
12 syls
checking: If your present degrees of belief are reasonable—or at least if they come from some reasonable initial credence function by conditionalizing on your total evidence—then the Principal Principle applies.
18 syls
checking: Your credences about outcomes conform to your firm beliefs and your partial beliefs about chances.
error
checking: Then the latter guide your life because the former do.
13 syls
checking: The greater chance you think the ticket has of winning, the greater should be your degree of belief that it will win; and the greater is your degree of belief that it will win, the more, ceteris paribus, it should be worth to you and the more you should be disposed to choose it over other desirable things.
18 syls
checking: Prospects for an Analysis of Chance Consider once more the Principal Principle as reformulated: Ptw(A) = C(A/HtwTw).
19 syls
checking: Or in words: the chance distribution at a time and a world comes from any reasonable initial credence function by conditionalizing on the complete history of the world up to the time, together with the complete theory of chance for the world.
19 syls
checking: Doubtless it has crossed your mind that this has at least the form of an analysis of chance.
20 syls
checking: But you may well doubt that it is informative as an analysis; that depends on the distance between the analysandum and the concepts employed in the analysans.
18 syls
checking: Not that it has to be informative as an analysis to be informative.
18 syls
checking: I hope I have convinced you that the Principal Principle is indeed informative, being rich in consequences that are central to our ordinary ways of thinking about chance.
18 syls
checking: There are two different reasons to doubt that the Principal Principle qualifies as an analysis.
18 syls
checking: The first concerns the allusion in the analysans to reasonable initial credence functions.
error
checking: The second concerns the allusion to complete theories of chance.
16 syls
checking: In both cases the challenge is the same: could we possibly get any independent grasp on this concept, otherwise than by way of the concept of chance itself?
18 syls
checking: In both end p.109 cases my provisional answer is: most likely not, but it would be worth trying.
error
checking: Let us consider the two problems in turn.
11 syls
checking: It would be natural to think that the Principal Principle tells us nothing at all about chance, but rather tells us something about what makes an initial credence function be a reasonable one.
18 syls
checking: To be reasonable is to conform to objective chances in the way described.
18 syls
checking: Put this strongly, the response is wrong: the Principle has consequences, as we noted, that are about chance and not at all about its relationship to credence.
18 syls
checking: (They would be acceptable, I trust, to a believer in objective single-case chance who rejects the very idea of degree of belief.
18 syls
checking: ) It tells us more than nothing about chance.
10 syls
checking: But perhaps it is divisible into two parts: one part that tells us something about chance, another that takes the concept of chance for granted and goes on to lay down a criterion of reasonableness for initial credence.
18 syls
checking: Is there any hope that we might leave the Principal Principle in abeyance, lay down other criteria of reasonableness that do not mention chance, and get a good enough grip on the concept that way?
20 syls
checking: It's a lot to ask.
6 syls
checking: For note that just as the Principal Principle yields some consequences that are entirely about chance, so also it yields some that are entirely about reasonable initial credence.
18 syls
checking: One such consequence is as follows.
9 syls
checking: There is a large class of propositions such that if Y is any one of these, and C 1 and C 2 are any two reasonable initial credence functions, then the functions that come from C 1 and C 2 by conditionalizing on Y are exactly the same.
18 syls
checking: (The large class is, of course, the class of members of history-theory partitions for all times.
20 syls
checking: ) That severely limits the ways that reasonable initial credence functions may differ, and so shows that criteria adequate to pick them out must be quite strong.
18 syls
checking: What might we try?
4 syls
checking: A reasonable initial credence function ought to (1) obey the laws of mathematical probability theory; (2) avoid dogmatism, at least by never assigning zero credence to possible propositions and perhaps also by never assigning infinitesimal credence to certain kinds of possible propositions; (3) make it possible to learn from experience by having a built-in bias in favor of worlds where the future in some sense resembles the past; and perhaps (4) obey certain carefully restricted principles of indifference, thereby respecting certain symmetries.
error
checking: Of these, critera (1)-(3) are all very well, but surely not yet strong enough.
error
checking: Given C 1 satisfying (1)(3), and given any proposition Y that holds at more than one world, it will be possible to distort C 1 very slightly to produce C 2 , such that C 1 (−/Y) and C 2 (−/Y) differ but C 2 also satisfies (1)-(3).
error
checking: It is less clear what (4) might be able to do for us.
error
checking: Mostly that is because (4) is less clear simpliciter, end p.110 in view of the fact that it is not possible to obey too many different restricted principles of indifference at once and it is hard to give good reasons to prefer some over their competitors.
error
checking: It also  remains possible, of course, that some criterion of reasonableness along different lines than any I have mentioned would do the trick.
22 syls
checking: I turn now to our second problem: the concept of a complete theory of chance.
19 syls
checking: In saying what makes a certain proposition be the complete theory of chance for a world (and for any world where it holds), I gave an explanation in terms of chance.
18 syls
checking: Could these same propositions possibly be picked out in some other way, without mentioning chance?
18 syls
checking: The question turns on an underlying metaphysical issue.
17 syls
added: The question turns on an underlying metaphysical issue.
checking: A broadly Humean doctrine (something I would very much like to believe if at all possible) holds that all the facts there are about the world are particular facts, or combinations thereof.
error
checking: This need not be taken as a doctrine of analyzability, since some combinations of particular facts cannot be captured in any finite way.
error
checking: It might be better taken as a doctrine of supervenience: if two worlds match perfectly in all matters of particular fact, they match perfectly in all other ways too—in modal properties, laws, causal connections, chances, .
error
checking: .
0 syls

0 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: It seems that if this broadly Humean doctrine is false, then chances are a likely candidate to be the fatal counter-instance.
error
checking: And if chances are not supervenient on particular fact, then neither are complete theories of chance.
error
checking: For the chances at a world are jointly determined by its complete theory of chance together with propositions about its history, which latter plainly are supervenient on particular fact.
19 syls
checking: If chances are not supervenient on particular fact, then neither chance itself nor the concept of a complete theory of chance could possibly be analyzed in terms of particular fact, or of anything supervenient thereon.
error
checking: The only hope for an analysis would be to use something in the analysans which is itself not supervenient on particular fact.
18 syls
checking: I cannot say what that something might be.
10 syls
checking: How might chance, and complete theories of chance, be supervenient on particular fact?
error
checking: Could something like this be right: the complete theory of chance for a world is that one of all possible complete theories of chance that somehow best fits the global pattern of outcomes and frequencies of outcomes?
18 syls
checking: It could not.
3 syls
checking: For consider any such global pattern, and consider a time long before the pattern is complete.
18 syls
checking: At that time, the pattern surely has some chance of coming about and some chance of not coming about.
18 syls
checking: There is surely some chance of a very different global pattern coming about; one which, according to the proposal under consideration, would make true some different end p.111 complete theory of chance.
19 syls
checking: But a complete theory of chance is not something that could have some chance of coming about or not coming about.
18 syls
checking: By the Principal Principle, Ptw(Tw) = C(Tw/HtwTw) = 1.
error
checking: If T w is something that holds in virtue of some global pattern of particular fact that obtains at world w, this pattern must be one that has no chance at any time (at w) of not obtaining.
19 syls
checking: If w is a world where many matters of particular fact are the outcomes of chance processes, then I fail to see what kind of global pattern this could possibly be.
18 syls
checking: But there is one more alternative.
9 syls
checking: I have spoken as if I took it for granted that different worlds have different history-to-chance conditionals, and hence different complete theories of chance.
18 syls
checking: Perhaps this is not so: perhaps all worlds are exactly alike in the dependence of chance on history.
18 syls
checking: Then the complete theory of chance for every world, and all the conditionals that comprise it, are necessary.
error
checking: They are supervenient on particular fact in the trivial way that what is noncontingent is supervenient on anything—no two worlds differ with respect to it.
error
checking: Chances are still contingent, but only because they depend on contingent historical propositions (information about the details of the coin and tosser, as it might be) and not also because they depend on a contingent theory of chance.
19 syls
checking: Our theory is much simplified if this is true.
13 syls
checking: Admissible information is simply historical information; the history-theory partition at t is simply the partition of alternative complete histories up to t; for any reasonable initial credence function C Ptw(A) = C(A/Htw), so that the chance distribution at t and w comes from C by conditionalizing on the complete history of w up to t. Chance is reasonable credence conditional on the whole truth about history up to a time.
19 syls
checking: The broadly Humean doctrine is upheld, so far as chances are concerned: what makes it  true at a time and a world that something has a certain chance of happening is something about matters of particular fact at that time and (perhaps) before.
error
checking: What's the catch?
4 syls
added:  Our theory is much simplified if this is true. What's the catch?
checking: For one thing, we are no longer safely exploring the consequences of the Principal Principle, but rather engaging in speculation.
18 syls
checking: For another, our broadly Humean speculation that history-to-chance conditionals are necessary solves our second problem by making the first one worse.
error
checking: Reasonable initial credence functions are constrained more narrowly than ever.
18 syls
checking: Any two of them, C 1 and C 2 , are now required to yield the same function by conditionalizing on the complete end p.112 history of any world up to any time.
error
checking: Put it this way: according to our broadly Humean speculation (and the Principal Principle) if I were perfectly reasonable and knew all about the course of history up to now (no matter what that course of history actually is, and no matter what time is now) then there would be only one credence function I could have.
error
checking: Any other would be unreasonable.
10 syls
checking: It is not very easy to believe that the requirements of reason leave so little leeway as that.
18 syls
checking: Neither is it very easy to believe in features of the world that are not supervenient on particular fact.
18 syls
checking: But if I am right, that seems to be the choice.
11 syls
checking: I shall not attempt to decide between the Humean and the anti-Humean variants of my approach to credence and chance.

error
checking: He offers a continuation of my questionnaire, says that his added questions fall outside the scope of the Principal Principle, and suggests that we need some Assistant Principle to deal with them.
19 syls
checking: His first added question is as follows.
10 syls
checking: 2 Question.
error
checking: You are sure that a certain coin is fair.
10 syls
checking: It was tossed this morning, but you have no information about the outcome of the toss.
19 syls
checking: To what degree should you believe the proposition that it landed heads?
18 syls
checking: Answer.
2 syls
checking: 50 per cent, of course.
error
checking: That's the right answer (provided the question is suitably interpreted).
20 syls
checking: But the Principal Principle, unassisted, does suffice to yield that answer.
18 syls
checking: What we must bear in mind is that the Principle relates time-dependent chance to time-dependent admissibility of evidence; and that it applies to any time, not only the present.
18 syls
checking: Kyburg thinks the Principle falls silent "since there is no chance that the coin fell other than the way it did," and quotes me to the effect that "what's past is no longer chancy".
error
checking: Right.
1 syls
checking: We won't  get anywhere if we apply the Principle to present chances.
18 syls
checking: But what's past was chancy, if indeed the coin was fair; so let's see what we get by applying the Principle to a past time, and working back to present credences.
18 syls
checking: Notation: end p.114 t: a time just before the toss, C: a reasonable initial credence function that will yield my later credences by conditionalizing on total evidence, C 0 : my present credence function, A: the proposition that the coin fell heads, X: the proposition that the coin was fair, that is that its chance at t of falling heads was 50%, E: the part of my present total evidence that is admissible at t, F: the rest of my present total evidence.
error
checking: Since ex hypothesi I'm certain of X, we have (1) C0 = C0( - /X).
error
checking: By definition of C, we have (2) C0 = C( - /EF).
error
checking: Assuming that F is irrelevant to the tosses, we have (3) C(A/XEF) = C(A/XE).
error
checking: By the Principal Principle, applied not to the present but to t, we have (4) C(A/XE) = 50 %.
18 syls
checking: Now, by routine calculation from (1)-(4) we have (5) C0(A) = 50 %.
error
checking: which answers Kyburg's question.
error
checking: Step (3) deserves further examination, lest you suspect it of concealing an Assistant Principle.
error
checking: Recall that F is the part of my present total evidence that was not admissible already at time t. Presumably it consists of historical information about the interval between t and the present.
18 syls
checking: For historical information about earlier times would be already admissible at t; and historical information about later times, or nonhistorical information, could scarcely be part of my present total evidence.
20 syls
checking: (Here, as in the paper, I set aside strange possibilities in which the normal asymmetries of time break down.
18 syls
checking: So far as I can tell, Kyburg is content to join me in so doing.
error
checking: ) Thus if I had watched the toss, or otherwise received information about its outcome, that information would be included in F. However, Kyburg stipulated in his question that "you have no information about the outcome of the toss".
19 syls
checking: We might reasonably construe that to mean that no information received between t and the present is end p.115 evidentially relevant to whether the coin fell heads, with evidential relevance construed in the usual way in terms of credence.
19 syls
checking: Then (3) comes out as a stipulated condition of the problem, not some extra principle.
error
checking: There is a different, stricter way that Kyburg's stipulation might perhaps be construed.
error
checking: It might only exclude information that settles the outcome decisively, leaving it open that I have information that bears evidentially on the outcome without settling it.
20 syls
checking: For instance, it might be that the tosser promised to phone me if the toss fell heads, I got no phone call, but that is far from decisive because my phone is not reliable.
error
checking: On that construal, we are not entitled to assume (3).
error
checking: But on that construal Kyburg's answer is wrong; or anyway it isn't right as a matter of course on the basis of what he tells us; so we don't want any principle that delivers that answer.
error
checking: Kyburg has a second added question to challenge the Principal Principle.
error
checking: Question.
2 syls
checking: As above, but you know that the coin was tossed 100 times, and landed heads 86 times.
error
checking: To what degree should you believe the proposition that it landed heads on the first toss?
18 syls
checking: Answer.
2 syls
checking: 86 per cent.
error
checking: The strategy for getting the Principal Principle to yield an answer is the same as before, but the calculation is more complicated.
19 syls
checking: Notation as before, except for A: the proposition that the coin fell heads on the first toss, B: the proposition that the coin fell heads 86 times out of 100, X: the proposition that the coin was fair, that is that its chance at t of falling heads was 50% on each toss, F: the rest of my present total evidence, besides the part that was admissible at t, and also besides the part B, x: the fraction of heads-tails sequences of length 100 in which there are 86 heads.
18 syls
checking: Our equations this time are as follows.
11 syls
checking: They are justified in much the same way as the likenumbered equations above.
error
checking: But this time, to get the new (2) we split the present total evidence into three parts B, E, and F. And to get the new (4), we use the Principal Principle repeatedly to multiply endpoint chances, as was explained in the section of the paper dealing with chance of frequency.
error
checking: end p.116 (1) As before; (2) C 0 = C(−/BEF); (3) C(A/XBEF) = C(A/XBE); (4) C(AB/XE) = x· 86%, C(B/XE) = x; (5) C 0 (A) = 86%.
error
checking: Kyburg also thinks I need an extra "Principle of Integration" which I neglected to state.
error
checking: But this principle, it turns out, has nothing especially to do with chance!
18 syls
checking: It is just a special case of a principle of infinite additivity for credences.
error
checking: Indeed it could be replaced, at the point where he claims I tacitly used it, by finite additivity of credences.
18 syls
checking: (And finite additivity goes without saying, though I nevertheless did say it.
error
checking: ) To be sure, if we want to treat credences in the setting of nonstandard analysis, we are going to want some kind of infinite additivity.
error
checking: And some kind of infinite additivity comes automatically when we start with finite additivity and then treat some infinite sets as if they were finite.
error
checking: It is an interesting question what kind of infinite additivity of credences we can reasonably assume in the nonstandard setting.
error
checking: But this question belongs entirely to the theory of credence—not to the connection between chance and credence that was the subject of my paper.

18 syls
checking: It was not I, but the hypothetical "you" in my example, who appeared ready to assign a 50% chance of heads.
18 syls

18 syls
checking: I myself am in a more complicated position than the character in this example.
19 syls
checking: (That is why I made an example of him, not me.
13 syls
checking: ) I would not give much credence to the proposition that the coin has a chance of heads of 50% exactly.
18 syls
checking: I would give a small share of credence to the proposition that it is zero exactly, and an equal small share to the proposition that it is one exactly.
18 syls
checking: I would divide most of the rest of my credence between the vicinity of 50%, the vicinity of zero, and the vicinity of one.
19 syls
checking: The small credence I give to the extremes, zero and one exactly, reflects my slight uncertainty about whether the world is chancy at all.
19 syls
checking: Accepted theory says it is, of course; but accepted theory is not in the best of foundational health, and the sick spot (reduction of the wave function brought on by measurement) is the very spot where the theory goes indeterministic.
18 syls
checking: But most of my credence goes to the orthodox view that there are plenty of chance processes in microphysics.
18 syls
checking: And not just the microphysics of extraordinary goings-on in particle accelerators!

20 syls
checking: In Levi's physics, a coin coming loose from fingers and tumbling in end p.118 air until it falls flat on a table is a classical system, an oasis of determinism in a chancy microworld.
18 syls
checking: I do not see how that can be.
8 syls
checking: The coin, and the fingers and the air and the table, are too much a part of that microworld.
18 syls
checking: There are also the external influences, which cannot be dismissed either by requiring them to be substantial or by invoking fictitious seals; but never mind, let us concentrate on the toss itself.
18 syls
checking: There is chance enough in the processes by which the coin leaves the fingers; in the processes whereby it bounces off air molecules and sends them recoiling off, perhaps to knock other molecules into its path; in the process whereby the coin does or doesn't stretch a bit as it spins, thereby affecting its moment of inertia; and in the processes whereby it settles down after first touching the table.
18 syls
checking: In ever so many minute ways, what happens to the coin is a matter of chance.
19 syls
checking: But all those chance effects are so minute.
10 syls
checking: —But a tossed coin is so sensitive to minute differences.
16 syls
checking: Which dominates—minuteness or sensitivity?
error
checking: That is a question to be settled not by asking what a philosopher would find it reasonable to suppose, but by calculation.
19 syls
checking: The calculations would be difficult.
10 syls
checking: We may not make them easier by approximations in which expected values replace chance distributions.
19 syls
checking: I have not heard of anyone who has attempted these calculations, and of course they are far beyond my own power.
18 syls
checking: Maybe they are beyond the state of the art altogether.
15 syls
checking: Without them, I haven't a clue whether the minuteness of the chance effects dominates, in which case the chance of heads is indeed close to zero or one; or whether instead the sensitivity dominates, in which case the chance of heads is close to 50%.
error
checking: Hence my own distribution of credence.
10 syls
checking: The hypothetical "you" in my example has a different, simpler distribution.
20 syls
checking: Why?
1 syls
checking: He might be someone who has done the calculations and found that the sensitivity dominates.
22 syls
checking: Or he might have been so foolish as to intuit that the sensitivity would dominate.
20 syls
checking: Or he might be altogether misinformed.
11 syls
checking: Well-informed people often say that ordinary gambling devices are deterministic systems.
19 syls
checking: Why?
1 syls
checking: Perhaps it is a hangover of instrumentalism.
error
checking: If we spoke as instrumentalists, we would be right to say so—meaning thereby not that they really are deterministic, but rather that it is sometimes instrumentally useful to pretend that they are.
18 syls
checking: To the extent that it is feasible to predict gambling devices at all—we can't predict heads or tails, but we can predict, for instance, that the coin won't tumble in mid-air until next year, and won't end up sticking to the wall—deterministic theories are as good predictive instruments as can be had.
19 syls
checking: Perhaps when the instrumentalist expert says that tossed end p.119  coins are deterministic, the philosopher misunderstands him, and thinks he means that tossed coins are deterministic.
error
checking: Can it be that Levi himself was speaking as an instrumentalist in the passages I cited?
18 syls
checking: If so, then the problem of reconciling chance and determinism is not very hard.
18 syls
checking: It is just the problem of reconciling truth simpliciter with truth in fiction.
error
checking: In truth, nobody lived at 221B Baker Street; in fiction, Holmes lived there.

checking: The character in my example, of course, was meant to be someone who believed that the chance of heads was 50% in truth—not in fiction, however instrumentally useful such fiction might be.
18 syls
checking: There is no chance without chance.
7 syls
checking: If our world is deterministic there are no chances in it, save chances of zero and one.
18 syls
checking: Likewise if our world somehow contains deterministic enclaves, there are no chances in those enclaves.
18 syls
checking: If a determinist says that a tossed coin is fair, and has an equal chance of falling heads or tails, he does not mean what I mean when he speaks of chance.
18 syls
checking: Then what does he mean?
5 syls
checking: This, I suppose, is the question Levi would like to see addressed.
16 syls
checking: It is, of course, a more urgent question for determinists than it is for me.
error
checking: That question has been sufficiently answered in the writings of Richard Jeffrey and Brian Skyrms on objectified and resilient credence.
18 syls
checking: 4 Without committing themselves one way or the other on the question of determinism, they have offered a kind of counterfeit chance to meet the needs of the determinist.
error
checking: It is a relative affair, and apt to go indeterminate, hence quite unlike genuine chance.
18 syls
checking: But what better could a determinist expect?
12 syls
checking: According to my second formulation of the Principal Principle, we have the history-theory partition (for any given time); and the chance distribution (for any given time and world) comes from any reasonable initial credence function by conditionalizing on the true cell of this partition.
19 syls
checking: That is, it is objectified in the sense of Jeffrey.
error
checking: Let us note three things about the history-theory partition.
16 syls
checking: (1) It seems to be a natural partition, not gerrymandered.
error
checking: It is what we get by dividing possibilities as finely as possible in certain straightforward respects.
18 syls
processed: 2500
checking: end p.120 (2) It is to some extent feasible to investigate (before the time in question) which cell of this partition is the true cell; but (3) it is unfeasible (before the time in question, and without peculiarities of time whereby we could get news from the future) to investigate the truth of propositions that divide the cells.
error
checking: Hence if we start with a reasonable initial credence function and do enough feasible investigation, we may expect our credences to converge to the chances; and no amount more feasible investigation (before the time) will undo that convergence.
18 syls
checking: That is, after enough investigation, our credences become resilient in the sense of Skyrms.
error
checking: And our credences conditional on cells of the partition are resilient from the outset.
error
checking: Conditions (1)-(3) characterize the history-theory partition; but not uniquely.
error
checking: Doubtless there are other, coarser partitions, that also satisfy the conditions.
18 syls
checking: How feasible is feasible?
8 syls
checking: Some investigations are more feasible than others, depending on the resources and techniques available, and there must be plenty of boundaries to be drawn between the feasible and the unfeasible before we get to the ultimate boundary whereby investigations that divide the history-theory cells are the most unfeasible of all.
18 syls
checking: Any coarser partition, if it satisfies conditions (1)-(3) according to some appropriate standards of feasible investigation and of natural partitioning, gives us a kind of counterfeit chance suitable for use by determinists: namely, reasonable credence conditional on the true cell of that partition.
error
checking: Counterfeit chances will be relative to partitions; and relative, therefore, to standards of feasibility and naturalness; and therefore indeterminate unless the standards are somehow settled, or at least settled well enough that all remaining candidates for the partition will yield the same answers.
18 syls
checking: Counterfeit chances are therefore not the sort of thing we would want to find in our fundamental physical theories, or even in our theories of radioactive decay and the like.
18 syls
checking: But they will do to serve the conversational needs of determinist gamblers.
18 syls
checking: C. Laws of Chance Despite the foundational problems of quantum mechanics, it remains a good guess that many processes are governed by probabilistic laws of nature.
19 syls
checking: These laws of chance, like other laws of nature, have the form of universal generalizations.
19 syls
checking: Just as some laws concern forces, which are magnitudes pertaining to particulars, so some laws concern single-case chances, which likewise are magnitudes pertaining to particulars.
21 syls
checking: end p.121 For instance, a law of chance might say that for any tritium atom and any time when it exists, there is such-and-such chance of that atom decaying within one second after that time.
error
checking: 5 What makes it at least a regularity—a true generalization—is that for each tritium atom and time, the chance of decay is as the law says it is.
error
checking: What makes it a law, I suggest, is the same thing that gives some others regularities the status of laws: it fits into some integrated system of truths that combines simplicity with strength in the best way possible.
error
checking: 6 This is a kind of regularity theory of lawhood; but it is a collective and selective regularity theory.
error
checking: Collective, since regularities earn their lawhood not by themselves, but by the joint efforts of a system in which they figure either as axioms or as theorems.
error
checking: Selective, because not just any regularity qualifies as a law.
18 syls
checking: If it would complicate the otherwise best system to include it as an axiom, or to include premises that would imply it, and if it would not add sufficient strength to pay its way, then it is left as a merely accidental regularity.
18 syls
checking: Five remarks about the best-system theory of lawhood may be useful before we return to our topic of how this theory works in the presence of chance.
error
checking: end p.122 (1) The standards of simplicity, of strength, and of balance between them are to be those that guide us in assessing the credibility of rival hypotheses as to what the laws are.
error
checking: In a way, that makes lawhood depend on us—a feature of the approach that I do not at all welcome!
error
checking: But at least it does not follow that lawhood depends on us in the most straightforward way: namely, that if our standards were suitably different, then the laws would be different.
error
checking: For we can take our actual standards as fixed, and apply them in asking what the laws would be in various counterfactual situations, including counterfactual situations in which people have different standards—or in which there are no people at all.
18 syls
checking: Likewise, it fortunately does not follow that the laws are different at other times and places where there live people with other standards.
18 syls
checking: (2) On this approach, it is not to be said that certain generalizations are lawlike whether or not they are true, and the laws are exactly those of the lawlikes that are true.
error
checking: There will normally be three possibilities for any given generalization: that it be false, that it be true but accidental, and that it be true as a law.
23 syls
checking: Whether it is true accidentally or as a law depends on what else is true along with it, thus on what integrated systems of truths are available for it to enter into.
18 syls
checking: To illustrate the point: it may be true accidentally that every gold sphere is less than one mile in diameter; but if gold were unstable in such a way that there was no chance whatever that a large amount of gold could last long enough to be formed into a one-mile sphere, then this same generalization would be true as a law.
19 syls
checking: (3) I do not say that the competing integrated systems of truths are to consist entirely of regularities; however, only the regularities in the best system are to be laws.
error
checking: It is open that the best system might include truths about particular places or things, in which case there might be laws about these particulars.
19 syls
checking: As an empirical matter, I do not suppose there are laws that essentially mention Smith's garden, the center of the earth or of the universe, or even the Big Bang.
21 syls
checking: But such laws ought not to be excluded a priori.
error
checking: 7 (4) It will trivialize our comparisons of simplicity if we allow our competing systems to be formulated with just any hoked-up primitives.
error
checking: end p.123 So I take it that this kind of regularity theory of lawhood requires some sort of inegalitarian theory of properties: simple systems are those that come out formally simple when formulated in terms of perfectly natural properties.
error
checking: Then, sad to say, it's useless (though true) to say that the natural properties are the ones that figure in laws.
20 syls
checking: 8 (5) If two or more systems are tied for best, then certainly any regularity that appears in all the tied systems should count as a law.
error
checking: But what of a regularity that appears in some but not all of the tied systems?
18 syls
checking: We have three choices: it is not a law (take the intersection of the tied systems); it is a law (take the union); it is indeterminate whether it is law (apply a general treatment for failed presuppositions of uniqueness).
18 syls
checking: If required to choose, I suppose I would favor the first choice; but it seems a reasonable hope that nature might be kind to us, and put some one system so far out front that the problem will not arise.
18 syls
checking: Likewise, we may hope that some system will be so far out front that it will win no matter what the standards of simplicity, strength, and balance are, within reason.
18 syls
checking: If so, it will also not matter if these standards themselves are unsettled.
19 syls
checking: To simplify, let me ignore the possibility of ties, or of systems so close to tied that indeterminacy of the standards matters; if need be, the reader may restore the needed complications.
18 syls
checking: To return to laws of chance: if indeed there are chances, they can be part of the subject matter of a system of truths; then regularities about them can appear as axioms or theorems of the best system; then such regularities are laws.
18 syls
checking: Other regularities about chances might fail to earn a place in the best system; those ones are accidental.
error
checking: All this is just as it would be for laws about other magnitudes.
17 syls
added: All this is just as it would be for laws about other magnitudes.
checking: So far, so good.
4 syls
checking: But there is a problem nearby; not especially a problem about laws of chance, but about laws generally in a chancy world.
18 syls
checking: We have said that a regularity is accidental if it cannot earn a place in the best system: if it is too weak to enter as an axiom, and also cannot be made to follow as a theorem unless by overloading the system with particular information.
19 syls
checking: That is one way to be accidental; but it seems that a regularity might be accidental also for a different and simpler reason.
20 syls
checking: It might hold merely by chance.
7 syls
checking: It might be simple and powerful and well deserve a place in the ideal system and yet be no law.
19 syls
checking: For it might have, or it might once have had, some chance of failing to hold; whereas it seems very clear, contra the best-system theory as so far stated, that no genuine law ever could have had any chance of not holding.
19 syls
checking: A world of end p.124 lawful chance might have both sorts of accidental regularities, some disqualified by their inadequate contribution to simplicity and strength and others by their chanciness.
error
checking: Suppose that radioactive decay is chancy in the way we mostly believe it to be.
19 syls
checking: Then for each unstable nucleus there is an expected lifetime, given by the constant chance of decay for a nucleus of that species.
19 syls
checking: It might happen—there is some chance of it, infinitesimal but not zero—that each nucleus lasted for precisely its expected lifetime, no more and no less.
18 syls
checking: Suppose that were so.
5 syls
checking: The regularity governing lifetimes might well qualify to join the best system, just as the corresponding regularity governing expected lifetimes does.
18 syls
checking: Still, it is not a law.
6 syls
checking: For if it were a law, it would be a law with some chance—in fact, an overwhelming chance—of being broken.
21 syls
checking: That cannot be so.
5 syls
checking: 9 (Admittedly, we do speak of defeasible laws, laws with exceptions, and so forth.
error
checking: But these, I take it, are rough-and-ready approximations to the real laws.
18 syls
checking: There real laws have no exceptions, and never had any chance of having any.
18 syls
checking: ) Understand that I am not supposing that the constant chances of decay are replaced by a law of constant lifetimes.
19 syls
checking: That is of course possible.
7 syls
checking: What is not possible, unfortunately for the bestsystem theory, is for the constant chances to remain and to coexist with a law of constant lifetimes.
error
checking: If the lifetimes chanced to be constant, and if the matter were well investigated, doubtless the investigators would come to believe in a law of constant lifetimes.
error
checking: But they would be mistaken, fooled by a deceptive coincidence.
17 syls
added: But they would be mistaken, fooled by a deceptive coincidence.
checking: It is one thing for a regularity to be a law; another thing for it to  be so regarded, however reasonably.
18 syls
checking: Indeed, there are philosophers who seem oblivious to the distinction; but I think these philosophers misrepresent their own view.
19 syls
checking: They are sceptics; they do not believe in laws of nature at all, they resort to regarded-as-law regularities as a substitute, and they call their substitute by the name of the real thing.
error
checking: end p.125 So the best-system theory of lawhood, as it stands, is in trouble.
error
checking: I propose this correction.
7 syls
checking: Previously, we held a competition between all true systems.
17 syls
added: Previously, we held a competition between all true systems.
checking: Instead, let us admit to the competition only those systems that are true not by chance; that is, those that not only are true, but also have never had any chance of being false.
18 syls
checking: The field of eligible competitors is thus cut down.
15 syls
checking: But then the competition works as before.
11 syls
checking: The best system is the one that achieves as much simplicity as is possible without excessive loss of strength, and as much strength as is possible without excessive loss of simplicity.
18 syls
checking: A law is a regularity that is included, as an axiom or as a theorem, in the best system.
19 syls
checking: Then a chance regularity, such as our regularity of constant lifetimes, cannot even be included in any of the competing systems.
18 syls
checking: A fortiori, it cannot be included in the best of them.
error
checking: Then it cannot count as a law.
8 syls
checking: It will be an accidental regularity, and for the right reason: because it had a chance of being false.
19 syls
checking: Other regularities may still be accidental for our original reason.
error
checking: These would be regularities that never had any chance of being false, but that don't earn their way into the best system because they don't contribute enough to simplicity and strength.
error
checking: For instance suppose that (according to regularities that do earn a place in the best system) a certain quantity is strictly conserved, and suppose that the universe is finite in extent.
error
checking: Then we have a regularity to the effect that the total of this quantity, over the entire universe, always equals a certain fixed value.
18 syls
checking: This regularity never had any chance of being false.
16 syls
checking: But it is not likely to earn a place in the best system and qualify as a law.
19 syls
checking: In the paper, I made much use of the history-to-chance conditionals giving hypothetical information about the chance distribution that would follow a given (fully specified) initial segment of history.
error
checking: Indeed, my reformulation of the Principal Principle involves a "complete theory of chance" which is the conjunction of all such history-to-chance conditionals that hold at a given world, and which therefore fully specifies the way chances at any time depend on history up to that time.
error
checking: It is to be hoped that the history-to-chance conditionals will follow, entirely or for the most part, from the laws of nature; and, in particular, from the laws of chance.
error
checking: We might indeed impose a requirement to that effect on our competing systems.
20 syls
checking: I have chosen not to.
6 syls
checking: While the thesis that chances might be entirely governed by law has some plausibility, I am not sure whether it deserves to be built into the analysis of lawhood.
18 syls
checking: Perhaps rather it is an empirical thesis: a virtue that we may hope distinguishes our world from more chaotic worlds.
18 syls
checking: At any rate, we can be sure that the history-to-chance conditionals end p.126 will not conflict with the system of laws of chance.
error
checking: Not, at any rate, in what they say about the outcomes and chances that would follow any initial segment of history that ever had any chance of coming about.
18 syls
checking: Let H be a proposition fully specifying such a segment.
18 syls
checking: Let t be a time at which there was some chance that H would come about.
17 syls
added: Let t be a time at which there was some chance that H would come about.
checking: Let L be the conjunction of the laws.
10 syls
checking: There was no chance, at t, of L being false.
11 syls
checking: Suppose for reductio first that we have a history-to-chance conditional "if H, then A" (where A might, for instance, specify chances at the end-time of the segment); and second that H and L jointly imply not-A, so that the conditional conflicts with the laws.
error
checking: The conditional had no chance at t of being false—this is an immediate consequence of the reformulated Principal Principle.
21 syls
checking: Since we had some chance at t of H, we had some chance of H holding along with the conditional, hence some chance of H and A. And since there was no chance that L would be false, there was some chance that all of H, A, and L would hold together, so some chance at t of a contradiction.
19 syls
checking: Which is impossible: there never can be any chance of a contradiction.
20 syls
checking: A more subtle sort of conflict also is ruled out.
13 syls
checking: Let t, L, and H be as before.
9 syls
checking: Suppose for reductio first that we have a history-to-chance conditional "if H, then there would be a certain positive chance of A"; and second that H and L jointly imply not-A.
error
checking: This is not the same supposition as before: after all, it would be no contradiction if something had a positive chance and still did not happen.
18 syls
checking: But it is still a kind of conflict: the definiteness of the law disagrees with the chanciness of the conditional.
error
checking: To rule it out, recall that we had at t some chance of H, but no chance of the conditional being false; so at t there was a chance of H holding along with the conditional; so at t there was a chance that, later, there would be a chance of A following the history H; but chanciness does not increase with time (assuming, as always, the normal asymmetries); an earlier chance of a later chance of something implies an earlier chance of it; so already at t there was some chance of H and A holding together.
18 syls
checking: Now we can go on as before: we have that at t there was no chance that L would be false, so some chance that all of H, A, and L would hold together, so some chance at t of a contradiction; which is impossible.
18 syls
checking: The best-system theory of lawhood in its original form served the cause of Humean supervenience.
error
checking: History, the pattern of particular fact throughout the universe, chooses the candidate systems, and the standards of selection do the rest.
18 syls
checking: So no two worlds could differ in laws without differing also in their history.
18 syls
checking: But our correction spoils that.
8 syls
checking: The laws—laws of chance, and other laws besides—supervene now on end p.127 the pattern of particular chances.
error
checking: If the chances in turn somehow supervene on history, then we have Humean supervenience of the laws as well; if not, not.
error
checking: The corrected theory of lawhood starts with the chances.
error
checking: It does nothing to explain them.
8 syls
checking: Once, circa 1975, I hoped to do better: to extend the best-system approach in such a way that it would provide for the Humean supervenience of chances and laws together, in one package deal.
error
checking: This was my plan.
4 syls
checking: We hold a competition of deductive systems, as before; but we impose less stringent requirements of eligibility to enter the competition, and we change the terms on which candidate systems compete.
18 syls
checking: We no longer require a candidate system to be entirely true, still less do we require that it never had any chance of being false.
19 syls
checking: Instead, we only require that a candidate system be true in what it says about history; we leave it open, for now, whether it also is true in what it says about chances.
18 syls
checking: We also impose a requirement of coherence: each candidate system must imply that the chances are such as to give that very system no chance at any time of being false.
19 syls
checking: Once we have our competing systems, they vary in simplicity and in strength, as before.
18 syls
checking: But also they vary in what I shall call fit: a system fits a world to the extent that the history of that world is a comparatively probable history according to that system.
18 syls
checking: (No history will be very probable; in fact, any history for a world like ours will be very improbable according to any system that deserves in the end to be accepted as correct; but still, some are more probable than others.
18 syls
checking: ) If the histories permitted by a system formed a tree with finitely many branch points and finitely many alternatives at each point, and the system specified chances for each alternative at each branch point, then the fit between the system and a branch would be the product of these chances along that branch; and likewise, somehow, for the general, infinite case.
error
checking: (Never mind the details if, as I think, the plan won't work anyway.
18 syls
checking: ) The best system will be the winner, now, in a three-way balance between simplicity, strength, and fit.
18 syls
checking: As before, the laws are the generalizations that appear as axioms or theorems in the best system; further, the true chances are the chances as they are according to the best system.
20 syls
checking: So it turns out that the best system is true in its entirety—true in what it says about chances, as well as in what it says about history.
18 syls
checking: So the laws of chance, as well as other laws, turn out to be true; and further, to have had no chance at any time of being false.
19 syls
checking: We have our Humean supervenience of chances and of laws; because history selects the candidate systems, history determines how well each one fits, and our standards of selection do the rest.
error
checking: We will tend, ceteris paribus, to get the proper agreement end p.128 between frequencies and uniform chances, because that agreement is conducive to fit.
error
checking: But we leave it open that frequencies may chance to differ from the uniform chances, since ceteris may  not be paribus and the chances are under pressure not only to fit the frequencies but also to fit into a simple and strong system.
20 syls
checking: All this seems very nice.
6 syls
checking: But it doesn't work.
error
checking: Along with simpler analyses of chance in terms of actual frequency, it falls victim to the main argument in the last section of the paper.
18 syls
checking: Present chances are determined by history up to now, together with history-to-chance conditionals.
18 syls
checking: These conditionals are supposed to supervene, via the laws of chance of the best system, on a global pattern of particular fact.
error
checking: This global pattern includes future history.
12 syls
checking: But there are various different futures which have some present chance of coming about, and which would make the best system different, and thus make the conditionals different, and thus make the present chances different.
18 syls
checking: We have the actual present chance distribution over alternative futures, determined by the one future which will actually come about.
19 syls
checking: Using it, we have the expected values of the present chances: the average of the present chances that would be made true by the various futures, weighted by the chances of those futures.
18 syls
checking: But these presently expected values of present chances may differ from the actual present chances.
18 syls
checking: A peculiar situation, to say the least.
12 syls
checking: And worse than peculiar.
6 syls
checking: Enter the Principal Principle: it says first that if we knew the present chances, we should conform our credences about the future to them.
19 syls
checking: But it says also that we should conform our credences to the expected values of the present chances.
error
checking: 10 If the two end p.129 differ, we cannot do both.
error
checking: So if the Principle is right (and if it is possible to conform our credences as we ought to), the two cannot differ.
18 syls
checking: So a theory that says they can is wrong.
10 syls
checking: That was the strategy behind my argument in the paper.
16 syls
checking: But I streamlined the argument by considering one credence in particular.
21 syls
checking: Let T be a full specification of history up to the present and of present chances; and suppose for reductio that F is a nonactual future, with some positive present chance of coming about, that would give a different present distribution of chances.
19 syls
checking: What is a reasonable credence for F conditionally on T?
18 syls
checking: Zero, because F contradicts T. But not zero, by the Principal Principle, because it should equal the positive chance of F according to T. This completes the reductio.
18 syls
checking: This streamlining might hide the way the argument exploits a predicament that arises already when we consider chance alone.
19 syls
checking: Even one who rejects the very idea of credence, and with it the Principal Principle, ought to be suspicious of a theory that permits discrepancies between the chances and their expected values.
18 syls
checking: If anyone wants to defend the best-system theory of laws and chances both (as opposed to the best-system theory of laws, given chances), I suppose the right move would be to cripple the Principal Principle by declaring that information about the chances at a time is not, in general, admissible at that time; and hence that hypothetical information about chances, which can join with admissible historical information to imply chances at a time, is likewise inadmissible.
19 syls
checking: The reason would be that, under the proposed analysis of chances, information about present chances is a disguised form of inadmissible information about future history—to some extent, it reveals the outcomes of matters that are presently chancy.
18 syls
checking: That crippling stops all versions of our reductio against positive present chances of futures that would end p.130 11 yield different present chances.
error
checking: I think the cost is excessive; in ordinary calculations with chances, it seems intuitively right to reply on this hypothetical information.
18 syls
checking: So, much as I would like to use the best-system approach in defense of Humean supervenience, I cannot support this way out of our difficulty.
18 syls
checking: I stand by my view, in the paper, that if there is any hope for Humean supervenience of chances, it lies in a different direction: the history-to-chance conditionals must supervene trivially, by not being contingent at all.
error
checking: As noted, that would impose remarkably stringent standards on reasonable belief.
20 syls
checking: To illustrate: on this hypothesis, enough purely historical information would suffice to tell a reasonable believer whether the half-life of radon is 3.
18 syls
checking: 825 days or 3.
error
checking: 852.
error
checking: What is more: enough purely historical information about any initial segment of the universe, however short, would settle the half-life!
19 syls
checking: (It might even be a segment before the time when radon first  appeared.
18 syls
checking: ) For presumably the half-life of radon is settled by the laws of chance; any initial segment of history, aided by enough noncontingent history-to-chance conditionals, suffices to settle any feature of the world that never had a chance to be otherwise; and the laws are such a feature.
18 syls
checking: But just how is the believer, however reasonable, supposed to figure out the half-life given his scrap of ancient history?
18 syls
checking: We can hope, I suppose, that some appropriate symmetries in the space of possibilities would do the trick.
error
checking: But it seems hard to connect these hoped-for symmetries with anything we now know about the workings of radioactive decay!
error
checking: D. Restricted Domains In reformulating the Principal Principle, I took care not to presuppose that the domain of a chance distribution would include all propositions.
error
checking: Elsewhere I was less cautious.
7 syls
checking: I am grateful to Zeno Swijtink for end p.131 pointing out (personal communication, 1984) that if I am to be uniformly noncommital on this point, two passages in my final section need correction.
error
checking: I say that if C 1 and C 2 are any two reasonable initial credence functions, and Y is any member of the history-theory partition for any time, then C 1 (−/Y) and C 2 (−/Y) are "exactly the same".
error
checking: Not so.
2 syls
checking: The most I can say is that they agree exactly in the values they assign to the propositions in a certain (presumably large) set; namely, the domain of the chance distribution implied by Y. My point stands: I have a consequence of the Principal Principle that is entirely about credence, and that limits the ways in which reasonable initial credence functions can differ.
18 syls
checking: Later I say that these differences are—implausibly—even more limited on the hypothesis that the complete theory of chance is the same for all worlds.
18 syls
checking: The same correction is required, this time with complete histories in place of history-theory conjunctions.
18 syls
checking: Again my point stands.
5 syls
checking: The limitation of difference is less than I said, but still implausibly stringent.
20 syls
checking: Unless, of course, there are very few propositions which fall in the domains of chance distributions; but that hypothesis also is very implausible, and so would not save the day for a noncontingent theory of chance and for Humean supervenience.
19 syls
checking: My reason for caution was not that I had in mind some interesting class of special propositions—as it might be, about free choices—that would somehow fail to have well-defined chances.
18 syls
checking: Rather, I thought it might lead to mathematical difficulties to assume that a probability measure is defined on all propositions without exception.
18 syls
checking: In the usual setting for probability theory—values in the standard reals, sigma-additivity—that assumption is indeed unsafe: by no means just any measure on a restricted domain of subsets of a given set can be extended to a measure on all the subsets.
18 syls
checking: I did not know whether there would be any parallel difficulty in the nonstandard setting; it probably depends on what sort of infinite additivity we wish to assume, just as the difficulty in the standard setting arises only when we require more than finite additivity.
18 syls
checking: Plainly this reason for caution is no reason at all to think that the domains of chance distributions will be notably sparser than the domains of idealized credence functions.
18 syls
checking: end p.132 Twenty Probabilities of Conditionals and Conditional Probabilities The truthful speaker wants not to assert falsehoods, wherefore he is willing to assert only what he takes to be very probably true.
error
checking: He deems it permissible to assert that A only if P(A) is sufficiently close to 1, where P is the probability function that represents his system of degrees of belief at the time.
18 syls
checking: Assertability goes by subjective probability.
error
checking: At least, it does in most cases.
8 syls
checking: But Ernest Adams has pointed out an apparent exception.
16 syls
checking: 1 In the case of ordinary indicative conditionals, it seems that assertability goes instead by the conditional subjective probability of the consequent, given the antecedent.
error
checking: We define the conditional probability function P(−/−) by a quotient of absolute probabilities, as usual: (1) P(C/A) =df P(CA)/P(A), if P(A) is positive.
18 syls
checking: (If the denominator P(A) is zero, we let P(C/A) remain undefined.
19 syls
checking: ) The truthful speaker evidently deems it permissible to assert the indicative conditional that if A, then C (for short, A → C) only if P(C/A) is end p.133 sufficiently close to 1.
18 syls
checking: Equivalently: only if P(CA) is sufficiently much greater than P( C A).
error
checking: Adams offers two sorts of evidence.
10 syls
checking: There is direct evidence, obtained by contrasting cases in which we would be willing or unwilling to assert various indicative conditionals.
18 syls
checking: There also is indirect evidence, obtained by considering various inferences with indicative conditional premises or conclusions.
20 syls
checking: The ones that seem valid turn out to be just the ones that preserve assertability, if assertability goes by conditional probabilities for conditionals and by absolute probabilities otherwise.
error
checking: 2 Our judgements of validity are not so neatly explained by various rival hypotheses.
error
checking: In particular, they do not fit the hypothesis that the inferences that seem valid are just the ones that preserve truth if we take the conditionals as truth-functional.
20 syls
checking: Adams has convinced me.
6 syls
checking: I shall take it as established that the assertability of an ordinary indicative conditional A → C does indeed go by the conditional subjective probability P(C/A).
error
checking: But why?
2 syls
checking: Why not rather by the absolute probability P(A → C)?
17 syls
added: Why not rather by the absolute probability P(A → C)?
checking: The most pleasing explanation would be as follows: The assertability of A → C does go by P(A → C) after all; indicative conditionals are not exceptional.
error
checking: But also it goes by P(C/A), as Adams says; for the meaning of → is such as to guarantee that P(A → C) and P(C/A) are always equal (if the latter is defined).
18 syls
checking: For short: probabilities of conditionals are conditional probabilities.
error
checking: This thesis has been proposed by various authors.
13 syls
checking: 3 If this is so, then of course the ordinary indicative conditional A → C cannot be the truthfunctional conditional A ⊃ C. P(A ⊃ C) and P(C/A) are equal only in certain extreme cases.
error
checking: The indicative conditional must be something else: call it a probability conditional.
22 syls
checking: We may or may not be able to give truth conditions for probability conditionals, but at least we may discover a good deal about their meaning and their logic just by using what we know about conditional probabilities.
20 syls
checking: Alas, this most pleasing explanation cannot be right.
14 syls
checking: We shall see end p.134 that there is no way to interpret a conditional connective so that, with sufficient generality, the probabilities of conditionals will equal the appropriate conditional probabilities.
error
checking: If there were, probabilities of conditionals could serve as links to establish relationships between the probabilities of non-conditionals, but the relationships thus established turn out to be incorrect.
error
checking: The quest for a probability conditional is futile, and we must admit that assertability does not go by absolute probability in the case of indicative conditionals.
18 syls
checking: Preliminaries Suppose we are given an interpreted formal language equipped at least with the usual truthfunctional connectives and with the further connective →.
18 syls
checking: These connectives may be used to compound any sentences in the language.
error
checking: We think of the interpretation as giving the truth value of every sentence at every possible world.
20 syls
checking: Two sentences are equivalent iff they are true at exactly the same worlds, and incompatible iff there is no world where both are true.
error
checking: One sentence implies another iff the second is true at every world where the first is true.
error
checking: A sentence is necessary, possible or impossible iff it is true at all worlds, at some, or at none.
error
checking: We may think of a probability function P as an assignment of numerical values to all sentences of this language, obeying these standard laws of probability: (2) 1 ≥ P(A) ≥ 0, (3) if A and B are equivalent, then P(A) = P(B), (4) if A and B are incompatible, then P(A V B) = P(A) + P(B), (5) if A is necessary, then P(A) = 1.
18 syls
checking: The definition (1) gives us the multiplication law for conjunctions.
error
checking: Whenever P(B) is positive, there is a probability function P′ such that P′(A) always equals P(A/B); we say that P′ comes from P by conditionalizing on B. A class of probability functions is closed under conditionalizing iff any probability function that comes by conditionalizing from one in the class is itself in the class.
19 syls
checking: Suppose that → is interpreted in such a way that, for some particular probability function P, and for any sentences A and C, (6) P(A → C) = P(C/A), if P(A) is positive.
19 syls
checking: iff so, let us call → a probability conditional for P. Iff → is a probability conditional for every probability function in some class of probability end p.135 functions, then let us call → a probability conditional for the class.
error
checking: And iff → is a probability conditional for all probability functions, so that (6) holds for any P, A, and C, then let us call → a universal probability conditional, or simply a probability conditional.
error
checking: Observe that if → is a universal probability conditional, so that (6) holds always, then (7) also holds always: (7) P(A → C/B) = P(C/AB), if P(AB) is positive.
19 syls
checking: To derive (7), apply (6) to the probability function P′ that comes from P by conditionalizing on B; such a P′ exists if P(AB) and hence also P(B) are positive.
error
checking: Then (7) follows by several applications of (1) and the equality between P′(−) and P(−/B).
error
checking: In the same way, if → is a probability conditional for a class of probability functions, and if that class is closed under conditionalizing, then (7) holds for any probability function P in the class, and for any A and C. (It does not follow, however, that if (6) holds for a particular probability function P, then (7) holds for the same P.) First Triviality Result Suppose by way of reductio that → is a universal probability conditional.
18 syls
checking: Take any probability function P and any sentences A and C such that P(AC) and P(A C ) both are positive.
18 syls
checking: Then P(A), P(C), and P( C ) also are positive.
14 syls
checking: By (6) we have: (8) P(A → C) = P(C/A).
error
checking: By (7), taking B as C or as C and simplifying the right-hand side, we have: (9) P(A → C/C) = P(C/AC) = 1, (10) P(A → C/C) = P(C/AC) = 0.
error
checking: For any sentence D, we have the familiar expansion by cases: (11) P(D) = P(D/C) · P(C) + P(D/C-) · P(C-).
18 syls
checking: In particular, take D as A → C. Then we may substitute (8), (9), and (10) into (11) to obtain: (12) P(C/A) = 1 · P(C) + 0 · P(C-) = P(C).
error
checking: With the aid of the supposed probability conditional, we have reached the conclusion that if only P(AC) and P(A C ) both are positive, then A end p.136 and C are probabilistically independent under P. That is absurd.
18 syls
checking: For instance, let P be the subjective probability function of someone about to throw what he takes to be a fair die, let A mean that an even number comes up, and let C mean that the six comes up.
18 syls
checking: P(AC) and P(A C ) are positive.
11 syls
checking: But, contra (12), P(C/A) is 1/3 and P(C) is 1/6; A and C are not independent.
error
checking: More generally, let C, D, and E be possible but pairwise incompatible.
error
checking: There are probability functions that assign positive probability to all three: let P be any such.
20 syls
checking: Let A be the disjunction C V D. Then P(AC) and P(A C ) are positive but P(C/A) and P(C) are unequal.
error
checking: Our supposition that → is a universal probability conditional has led to absurdity, but not quite to contradiction.
18 syls
checking: If the given language were sufficiently weak in expressive power, then our conclusion might be unobjectionable.
18 syls
checking: There might not exist any three possible but pairwise incompatible sentences to provide a counterexample to it.
error
checking: For all I have said, such a weak language might be equipped with a universal probability conditional.
20 syls
checking: Indeed, consider the extreme case of a  language in which there are none but necessary sentences and impossible ones.
18 syls
checking: For this very trivial language, the truth-functional conditional itself is a universal probability conditional.
18 syls
checking: If an interpreted language cannot provide three possible but pairwise incompatible sentences, then we may justly call it a trivial language.
error
checking: We have proved this theorem: any language having a universal probability conditional is a trivial language.
22 syls
checking: Second Triviality Result Since our language is not a trivial one, our indicative conditional must not be a universal probability conditional.
20 syls
checking: But all is not yet lost for the thesis that probabilities of conditionals are conditional probabilities.
error
checking: A much less than universal probability conditional might be good enough.
18 syls
checking: Our task, after all, concerns subjective probability: probability functions used to represent people's systems of beliefs.
21 syls
checking: We need not assume, and indeed it seems rather implausible, that any probability function whatever represents a system of beliefs that it is possible for someone to have.
19 syls
checking: We might set aside those probability functions that do not.
16 syls
checking: If our indicative conditional were a probability conditional for a limited class of probability functions, and if that class were inclusive enough to contain any probability function that might ever represent a speaker's system of beliefs, that would suffice to end p.137 explain why assertability of indicative conditionals goes by conditional subjective probability.
18 syls
checking: Once we give up on universality, it may be encouraging to find that probability conditionals for particular probability functions, at least, commonly do exist.
18 syls
checking: Given a probability function P, we may be able to tailor the interpretation of → to fit.
19 syls
checking: 4 Suppose that for any A and C there is some B such that P(B/ A ) and P(C/A) are equal if both defined; this should be a safe assumption when P is a probability function rich enough to represent someone's system of beliefs.
error
checking: If for any A and C we arbitrarily choose such a B and let A → C be interpreted as equivalent to AC V A B, then → is a probability conditional for P. But such piecemeal tailoring does not yet provide all that we want.
18 syls
checking: Even if there is a probability conditional for each probability function in a class, it does not follow that there is one probability conditional for the entire class.
22 syls
checking: Different members of the class might require different interpretations of → to make the probabilities of conditionals and the conditional probabilities come out equal.
20 syls
checking: But presumably our indicative conditional has a fixed interpretation, the same for speakers with different beliefs, and for one speaker before and after a change in his beliefs.
18 syls
checking: Else how are disagreements about a conditional possible, or changes of mind?
18 syls
checking: Our question, therefore, is whether the indicative conditional might have one fixed interpretation that makes it a probability conditional for the entire class of all those probability functions that represent possible systems of beliefs.
18 syls
checking: This class, we may reasonably assume, is closed under conditionalizing.
error
checking: Rational change of belief never can take anyone to a subjective probability function outside the class; and there are good reasons why the change of belief that results from coming to know an item of new evidence should take place by conditionalizing on what was learned.
19 syls
checking: 5 Suppose by way of reductio that → is a probability conditional for a class of probability functions, and that the class is closed under conditionalizing.
error
checking: The argument proceeds much as before.
10 syls
checking: Take any probability function P in the class and any sentences A and C such that end p.138 P(AC) and P(A C ) are positive.
20 syls
checking: Again we have (6) and hence (8); (7) and hence (9) and (10); (11) and hence by substitution (12): P(C/A) and P(C) must be equal.
error
checking: But if we take three pairwise incompatible sentences C, D, and E such that P(C), P(D), and P(E) are all positive and if we take A as the disjunction C V D, then P(AC) and P(A C ) are positive but P(C/A) and P(C) are unequal.
error
checking: So there are no such three sentences.
9 syls
checking: Further, P has at most four different values.
12 syls
checking: Else there would be two different values of P, x and y, strictly intermediate between 0 and 1 and such  that x + y ≠ 1.
22 syls
checking: But then if P(F) = x and P(G) = y it follows that at least three of P(FG), P( F G), P(F G ), and P( F G ) are positive, which we have seen to be impossible.
18 syls
checking: If a probability function never assigns positive probability to more than two incompatible alternatives, and hence is at most four-valued, then we may call it a trivial probability function.
21 syls
checking: We have proved this theorem: if a class of probability functions is closed under conditionalizing, then there can be no probability conditional for that class unless the class consists entirely of trivial probability functions.
18 syls
checking: Since some probability functions that represent possible systems of belief are not trivial, our indicative conditional is not a probability conditional for the class of all such probability functions.
18 syls
checking: Whatever it may mean, it cannot possibly have a meaning such as to guarantee, for all possible subjective probability functions at once, that the probabilities of conditionals equal the corresponding conditional probabilities.
18 syls
checking: There is no such meaning to be had.
9 syls
checking: We shall have to grant that the assertability of indicative conditionals does not go by absolute probability, and seek elsewhere for an explanation of the fact that it goes by conditional probability instead.
error
checking: The Indicative Conditional as Non-Truth-Valued Assertability goes in general by probability because probability is probability of truth and the speaker wants to be truthful.
error
checking: If this is not so for indicative conditionals, perhaps the reason is that they have no truth values, no truth conditions, and no probabilities of truth.
error
checking: Perhaps they are governed not by a semantic rule of truth but by a rule of assertability.
18 syls
checking: We might reasonably take it as the goal of semantics to specify our prevailing rules of assertability.
19 syls
checking: Most of the time, to be sure, that can best be done by giving truth conditions plus the general rule that end p.139 speakers should try to be truthful, or in other words that assertability goes by probability of truth.
19 syls
checking: But sometimes the job might better be done another way: for instance, by giving truth conditions for antecedents and for consequents, but not for whole conditionals, plus the special rule that the assertability of an indicative conditional goes by the conditional subjective probability of the consequent given the antecedent.
18 syls
checking: Why not?
2 syls
checking: We are surely free to institute a new sentence form, without truth conditions, to be used for making it known that certain of one's conditional subjective probabilities are close to 1.
20 syls
checking: But then it should be no surprise if we turn out to have such a device already.
18 syls
checking: Adams himself seems to favor this hypothesis about the semantics of indicative conditionals.
19 syls
checking: 6 He advises us, at any rate, to set aside questions about their truth and to concentrate instead on their assertability.
error
checking: There is one complication: Adams does say that conditional probabilities are probabilities of conditionals.
21 syls
checking: Nevertheless he does not mean by this that the indicative conditional is what I have here called a probability conditional; for he does not claim that the so-called "probabilities" of conditionals are probabilities of truth, and neither does he claim that they obey the standard laws of probability.
20 syls
checking: They are probabilities only in name.
11 syls
checking: Adams's position is therefore invulnerable to my triviality results, which were proved by applying standard laws of probability to the probabilities of conditionals.
21 syls
checking: Would it make sense to suppose that indicative conditionals do not have truth values, truth conditions, or probabilities of truth, but that they do have probabilities that obey the standard laws?
error
checking: Yes, but only if we first restate those laws to get rid of all mention of truth.
18 syls
checking: We must continue to permit unrestricted compounding of sentences by means of the usual connectives, so that the domain of our probability functions will be a Boolean algebra (as is standardly required); but we can no longer assume that these connectives always have their usual truth-functional interpretations, since truth-functional compounding of non-truth-valued sentences makes no sense.
19 syls
checking: Instead we must choose some deductive system—any standard formalization of sentential logic will do—and characterize the usual connectives by their deductive role in this system.
20 syls
checking: We must replace mention of equivalence, incompatibility, and necessity in laws (3) through (5) by mention of their syntactic  substitutes in the chosen system: inter-deducibility, deductive inconsistency, and deducibility.
18 syls
checking: In this way we could describe the end p.140 probability functions for our language without assuming that all probabilities of sentences, or even any of them, are probabilities of truth.
error
checking: We could still hold that assertability goes in most cases by probability, though we could no longer restate this as a rule that speakers should try to tell the truth.
error
checking: Merely to deny that probabilities of conditionals are probabilities of truth, while retaining all the standard laws of probability in suitably adapted form, would not yet make it safe to revive the thesis that probabilities of conditionals are conditional probabilities.
error
checking: It was not the connection between truth and probability that led to my triviality results, but only the application of standard probability theory to the probabilities of conditionals.
18 syls
checking: The proofs could just as well have used versions of the laws that mentioned deducibility instead of truth.
error
checking: Whoever still wants to say that probabilities of conditionals are conditional probabilities had better also employ a non-standard calculus of "probabilities".
error
checking: He might drop the requirement that the domain of a probability function is a Boolean algebra, in order to exclude conjunctions with conditional conjuncts from the language.
18 syls
checking: Or he might instead limit (4), the law of additivity, refusing to apply it when the disjuncts A and B contain conditional conjuncts.
error
checking: Either maneuver would block my proofs.
9 syls
checking: But if it be granted that the "probabilities" of conditionals do not obey the standard laws, I do not see what is to be gained by insisting on calling them "probabilities".
error
checking: It seems to me that a position like Adams's might best be expressed by saying that indicative conditionals have neither truth values nor probabilities, and by introducing some neutral term such as "assertability" or "value" which denotes the probability of truth in the case of nonconditionals and the appropriate conditional probability in the case of indicative conditionals.
18 syls
checking: I have no conclusive objection to the hypothesis that indicative conditionals are non-truthvalued sentences, governed by a special rule of assertability that does not involve their nonexistent probabilities of truth.
20 syls
checking: I have an inconclusive objection, however: the hypothesis requires too much of a fresh start.
18 syls
checking: It burdens us with too much work still to be done, and wastes too much that has been done already.
18 syls
checking: So far, we have nothing but a rule of assertability for conditionals with truthvalued antecedents and consequents.
error
checking: But what about compound sentences that have such conditionals as constituents?
error
checking: We think we know how the truth conditions for compound sentences of various kinds are determined by the truth conditions of constituent subsentences, but this knowledge would be useless if any of those subsentences end p.141 lacked truth conditions.
20 syls
checking: Either we need new semantic rules for many familiar connectives and operators when applied to indicative conditionals—perhaps rules of truth, perhaps special rules of assertability like the rule for conditionals themselves—or else we need to explain away all seeming examples of compound sentences with conditional constituents.
error
checking: The Indicative Conditional as Truth-Functional Fortunately a more conservative hypothesis is at hand.
18 syls
checking: H. P. Grice has given an elegant explanation of some qualitative rules governing the assertability of indicative conditionals.
20 syls
checking: 7 It turns out that a quantitative hypothesis based on Grice's ideas gives us just what we want: the rule that assertability goes by conditional subjective probability.
error
checking: According to Grice, indicative conditionals do have truth values, truth conditions, and probabilities of truth.
error
checking: In fact, the indicative conditional A → C is simply the truth-functional conditional A ⊃ C. But the assertability of this truth-functional conditional does not go just by P(A ⊃ C), its subjective probability of truth.
18 syls
checking: It goes by the resultant of that and something else.
13 syls
checking: It may happen that a speaker believes a truth-functional conditional to be true, yet he ought not to assert it.
19 syls
checking: Its assertability might be diminished for various reasons, but let us consider one in particular.
error
checking: The speaker ought not to assert the conditional if he believes it to be true predominantly  because he believes its antecedent to be false, so that its probability of truth consists mostly of its probability of vacuous truth.
18 syls
checking: In this situation, why assert the conditional instead of denying the antecedent?
20 syls
checking: It is pointless to do so.
7 syls
checking: And if it is pointless, then also it is worse than pointless: it is misleading.
20 syls
checking: The hearer, trusting the speaker not to assert pointlessly, will assume that he has not done so.
error
checking: The hearer may then wrongly infer that the speaker has additional reason to believe that the conditional is true, over and above his disbelief in the antecedent.
18 syls
checking: This consideration detracts from the assertability of A ⊃ C to the extent that both of two conditions hold: first, that the probability P( A ) end p.142 of vacuity is high; and second, that the probability P( C A) of falsity is a large fraction of the total probability P(A) of nonvacuity.
error
checking: The product (13) P(A-) · (P(C-A)/P(A)) of the degrees to which the two conditions are met is therefore a suitable measure of diminution of assertability.
error
checking: Taking the probability P(A ⊃ C) of truth, and subtracting the diminution of assertability as measured by (13), we obtain a suitable measure of resultant assertability: (14) P(A ⊃ C) – P(A-) · (P(C-A)/P(A)).
18 syls
checking: But (14) may be simplified, using standard probability theory; and so we find that the resultant assertability, probability of truth minus the diminution given by (13), is equal to the conditional probability P(C/ A).
error
checking: That is why assertability goes by conditional probability.
error
checking: Diminished assertability for such reasons is by no means special to conditionals.
error
checking: It appears also with uncontroversially truth-functional constructions such as negated conjunction.
error
checking: We are gathering mushrooms; I say to you "You won't eat that one and live".
18 syls
checking: A dirty trick: I thought that one was safe and especially delicious, I wanted it myself, so I hoped to dissuade you from taking it without actually lying.
18 syls
checking: I thought it highly probable that my trick would work, that you would not eat the mushroom, and therefore that I would turn out to have told the truth.
18 syls
checking: But though what I said had a high subjective probability of truth, it had a low assertability and it was a misdeed to assert it.
18 syls
checking: Its assertability goes not just by probability but by the resultant of that and a correction term to take account of the pointlessness and misleadingness of denying a conjunction when one believes it false predominantly because of disbelieving one conjunct.
error
checking: Surely few would care to explain the low assertability of what I said by rejecting the usual truth-functional semantics for negation and conjunction, and positing instead a special probabilistic rule of assertability.
error
checking: There are many considerations that might detract from assertability.
error
checking: Why stop at (14)?
error
checking: Why not add more terms to take account of the diminished assertability of insults, of irrelevancies, of long-winded pomposities, of breaches of confidence, and so forth?
error
checking: Perhaps part of the reason is that, unlike the diminution of assertability when the probability of a conditional is predominantly due to the improbability of the antecedent, these other diminutions depend heavily on miscellaneous features of the conversational context.
error
checking: In logic we are accustomed to consider sentences and inferences in abstraction from end p.143 context.
20 syls
checking: Therefore it is understandable if, when we philosophize, our judgements of assertability or of assertability-preserving inference are governed by a measure of assertability such as (14), that is P(C/A), in which the more context-dependent dimensions of assertability are left out.
error
checking: There is a more serious problem, however.
12 syls
checking: What of conditionals that have a high probability predominantly because of the probability of the consequent?
error
checking: If we are on the right track, it seems that there should be a diminution of assertability in this case also, and one that should still show up if we abstract from context: we could argue that in such a case it is pointless, and hence also misleading, to assert the conditional rather than the consequent.
18 syls
checking: This supposed diminution is left out, and I think rightly so, if we measure the assertability of a conditional A ⊃ C (in abstraction from context) by P(C/A).
18 syls
checking: If A and C are probabilistically independent and each has probability .
error
checking: 9, then the probability of the conditional (.
error
checking: 91) is predominantly due to the probability of the consequent (.
error
checking: 9), yet the conditional probability P(C/A) is high (.
error
checking: 9) so we count the conditional as  assertable.
error
checking: And it does seem so, at least in some cases: "I'll probably flunk, and it doesn't matter whether I study; I'll flunk if I do and I'll flunk if I don't".
error
checking: The best I can do to account for the absence of a marked diminution in the case of the probable consequent is to concede that considerations of conversational pointlessness are not decisive.
19 syls
checking: They create only tendencies toward diminished assertability, tendencies that may or may not be conventionally reinforced.
error
checking: In the case of the improbable antecedent, they are strongly reinforced.
20 syls
checking: In the case of the probable consequent, apparently they are not.
18 syls
checking: In conceding this, I reduce the distance between my present hypothesis that indicative conditionals are truth-functional and the rival hypothesis that they are non-truth-valued and governed by a special rule of assertability.
20 syls
checking: Truth conditions plus general conversational considerations are not quite the whole story.
18 syls
checking: They go much of the way toward determining the assertability of conditionals, but a separate convention is needed to finish the job.
error
checking: The point of ascribing truth conditions to indicative conditionals is not that we can thereby get rid entirely of special rules of assertability.
error
checking: Rather, the point of ascribing truth conditions is that we thereby gain at least a prima facie theory of the truth conditions and assertability of compound sentences with conditional constituents.
error
checking: We need not waste whatever general knowledge we have about the way the truth conditions of compounds depend on the truth conditions of their constituents.
18 syls
checking: end p.144 Admittedly we might go wrong by proceeding in this way.
error
checking: We have found one explicable discrepancy between assertability and probability in the case of conditionals themselves, and there might be more such discrepancies in the case of various compounds of conditionals.
error
checking: (For instance, the assertability of a negated conditional seems not to go by its probability of truth, but rather to vary inversely with the assertability of the conditional.
error
checking: ) It is beyond the scope of this paper to survey the evidence, but I think it reasonable to hope that the discrepancies are not so many, or so difficult to explain, that they destroy the explanatory power of the hypothesis that the indicative conditional is truth-functional.
18 syls
checking: Probabilities of Stalnaker Conditionals It is in some of the writings of Robert Stalnaker that we find the fullest elaboration of the thesis that conditional probabilities are probabilities of conditionals.
error
checking: 8 Stalnaker's conditional connective > has truth conditions roughly as follows: a conditional A > C is true iff the least drastic revision of the facts that would make A true would make C true as well.
error
checking: Stalnaker conjectures that this interpretation will make P(A > C) and P(C/A) equal whenever P(A) is positive.
18 syls
checking: He also lays down certain constraints on P(A > C) for the case that P(A) is zero, explaining this by means of an extended concept of conditional probability that need not concern us here.
18 syls
checking: Stalnaker supports his conjecture by exhibiting a coincidence between two sorts of validity.
19 syls
checking: The sentences that are true no matter what, under Stalnaker's truth conditions, turn out to be exactly those that have positive probability no matter what, under his hypothesis about probabilities of conditionals.
18 syls
checking: Certainly this is weighty evidence, but it is not decisive.
17 syls
added: Certainly this is weighty evidence, but it is not decisive.
checking: Cases are known in modal logic, for instance, in which very different interpretations of a language happen to validate the very same sentences.
19 syls
checking: And indeed our triviality results show that end p.145 Stalnaker's conjecture cannot be right, unless we confine our attention to trivial probability functions.
error
checking: 9 But it is almost right, as we shall see.
error
checking: Probabilities of Stalnaker conditionals do not, in general, equal the corresponding conditional probabilities.
error
checking: 10 But they do have some of the characteristic properties of conditional probabilities.
error
checking: A possible totality of facts corresponds to a possible world; so a revision of facts corresponds to a transition from one world to another.
18 syls
checking: For any given world W and (possible) antecedent A, let W A be the world we reach by the least drastic revision of the facts of W that makes  A true.
18 syls
checking: There is to be no gratuitous revision: W A may differ from W as much as it must to permit A to hold, but no more.
19 syls
checking: Balancing off respects of similarity and difference against each other according to the importance we attach to them, W A is to be the closest in overall similarity to W among the worlds where A is true.
18 syls
checking: Then the Stalnaker conditional A > C is true at the world W iff C is true at W A , the closest A-world to W. (In case the antecedent A is impossible, so that there is no possible A-world to serve as W A , we take A > C to be vacuously true at all worlds.
19 syls
checking: For simplicity I speak here only of absolute impossibility; Stalnaker works with impossibility relative to worlds.
20 syls
checking: ) Let us introduce this notation: (15) ⎧1 if A is true at the world W ⎫ ⎬.
error
checking: W(A) =df ⎨ ⎩0 if A is false at W ⎭ Then we may give the truth conditions for nonvacuous Stalnaker conditionals as follows: (16) W(A > C) = WA(C), if A is possible.
error
checking: end p.146 It will be convenient to pretend, from this point on, that there are only finitely many possible worlds.
error
checking: That will trivialize the mathematics but not distort our conclusions.
20 syls
checking: Then we can think of a probability function P as a distribution of probability over the worlds.
20 syls
checking: Each world W has a probability P(W), and these probabilities of worlds sum to 1.
18 syls
checking: We return from probabilities of worlds to probabilities of sentences by summing the probabilities of the worlds where a sentence is true: (17) P(A) = ∑W P(W) · W(A).
18 syls
checking: I shall also assume that the worlds are distinguishable: for any two, some sentence of our language is true at one but not the other.
18 syls
checking: Thus we disregard phenomena that might result if our language were sufficiently lacking in expressive power.
18 syls
checking: Given any probability function P and any possible A, there is a probability function P′ such that, for any world W′, (18) P’(W’) = ∑W P(W) · {1 if WA is W’, 0 otherwise}.
18 syls
checking: Let us say that P′ comes from P by imaging on A, and call P′ the image of P on A. Intuitively, the image on A of a probability function is formed by shifting the original probability of each world W over to W A , the closest A-world to W. Probability is moved around but not created or destroyed, so the probabilities of worlds still sum to 1.
18 syls
checking: Each A-world keeps whatever probability it had originally, since if W is an A-world then W A is W itself, and it may also gain additional shares of probability that have been shifted away from A -worlds.
19 syls
checking: The A -worlds retain none of their original probability, and gain none.
18 syls
checking: All the probability has been concentrated on the A-worlds.
17 syls
added: All the probability has been concentrated on the A-worlds.
checking: And this has been accomplished with no gratuitous movement of probability.
21 syls
checking: Every share stays as close as it can to the world where it was originally located.
21 syls
checking: Suppose that P′ comes from P by imaging on A, and consider any sentence C. (19) P’(C) = ∑W’ P’(W’) · W’(C), by (17) applied to P’; = ∑W’ (P(W) · {1 if WA is W’, 0 otherwise}) · W’(C), by (18); = ∑W P(W) · (∑W’{1 if WA is W’, 0 otherwise} · W’(C)), by algebra; = ∑W P(W) · WA(C), simplifying the inner sum; = ∑W P(W) · W(A > C), by (16); = P(A > C), by (17).
19 syls
checking: end p.147 We have proved this theorem: the probability of a Stalnaker conditional with a possible antecedent is the probability of the consequent after imaging on the antecedent.
error
checking: Conditionalizing is one way of revising a given probability function so as to confer certainty—probability of 1—on a given sentence.
error
checking: Imaging is another way to do the same thing.
13 syls
checking: The two methods do not in general agree.
12 syls
checking: (Example: let P(W), P(W′), and P(W″) each equal 1/3; let A hold at W and W′ but not W″; and let W′ be the closest A-world to W″.
18 syls
checking: Then the probability function that comes from P by conditionalizing on A assigns probability 1/2 to both W and W′; whereas the probability function that comes from P by imaging on A assigns probability 1/3 to W and 2/3 to W′.
error
checking: )  But though the methods differ, either one can plausibly be held to give minimal revisions: to revise the given probability function as much as must be done to make the given sentence certain, but no more.
18 syls
checking: Imaging P on A gives a minimal revision in this sense: unlike all other revisions of P to make A certain, it involves no gratuitous movement of probability from worlds to dissimilar worlds.
19 syls
checking: Conditionalizing P on A gives a minimal revision in this different sense: unlike all other revisions of P to make A certain, it does not distort the profile of probability ratios, equalities, and inequalities among sentences that imply A.11 Stalnaker's conjecture divides into two parts.
error
checking: This part is true: the probability of a nonvacuous Stalnaker conditional is the probability of the consequent, after minimal revision of the original probability function to make the antecedent certain.
error
checking: But it is not true that this minimal revision works by conditionalizing.
error
checking: Rather it must work by imaging.
9 syls
checking: Only when the two methods give the same result does the probability of a Stalnaker conditional equal the corresponding conditional probability.
19 syls
checking: Stalnaker gives the following instructions for deciding whether or not you believe a conditional.
18 syls
checking: 12 First, add the antecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of beliefs; second, make whatever adjustments are required to maintain consistency (without modifying the hypothetical belief in the antecedent); finally, consider whether or not the consequent is true.
error
checking: That is right, for a Stalnaker conditional, if the feigned revision of beliefs works by imaging.
18 syls
checking: However the passage suggests that the thing end p.148 to do is to feign the sort of revision that would take place if the antecedent really were added to your stock of beliefs.
error
checking: That is wrong.
3 syls
checking: If the antecedent really were added, you should (if possible) revise by conditionalizing.
19 syls
checking: The reasons in favor of responding to new evidence by conditionalizing are equally reasons against responding by imaging instead.
error
checking: Probability-Revision Conditionals Suppose that the connective → is interpreted in such a way that for any probability function P, and for any sentences A and C, (20) P(A → C) = PA(C), if A is possible, where P A is (in some sense) the minimal revision of P that raises the probability of A to 1.
error
checking: Iff so, let us call → a probability-revision conditional.
error
checking: Is there such a thing?
5 syls
added:  Rather it must work by imaging. That is wrong. Is there such a thing?
checking: We have seen that it depends on the method of revision.
15 syls
checking: Conditionalizing yields revisions that are minimal in one sense; and if P A is obtained (when possible) by conditionalizing, then no probability-revision conditional exists (unless the language is trivial).
error
checking: Imaging yields revisions that are minimal in another sense; and if P A is obtained by imaging then the Stalnaker conditional is a probability-revision conditional.
18 syls
checking: Doubtless there are still other methods of revision, yielding revisions that are minimal in still other senses than we have yet considered.
18 syls
checking: Are there any other methods which, like imaging and unlike conditionalizing, can give us a probability-revision conditional?
error
checking: There are not, as we shall see.
7 syls
checking: The only way to have a probability-revision conditional is to interpret the conditional in Stalnaker's way and revise by imaging.
19 syls
checking: Since we have not fixed on a particular method of revising probability functions, our definition of a probability-revision conditional should be understood as tacitly relative to a method.
22 syls
checking: To make this relativity explicit, let us call → a probability-revision conditional for a given method iff (20) holds in general when P A is taken to be the revision obtained by that method.
20 syls
checking: Our definition of a Stalnaker conditional should likewise be understood as tacitly relative to a method of revising worlds.
18 syls
checking: Stalnaker's truth conditions were deliberately left vague at the point where they mention the minimal revision of a given world to make a given antecedent true.
18 syls
checking: With worlds, as with probability functions, different end p.149  methods of revision will yield revisions that are minimal in different senses.
error
checking: We can indeed describe any method as selecting the antecedent-world closest in overall similarity to the original world; but different methods will fit this description under different resolutions of the vagueness of similarity, resolutions that stress different respects of comparison.
19 syls
checking: To be explicit, let us call → a Stalnaker conditional for a given method of revising worlds iff (16) holds in general when W A is taken to be the revision obtained by that method (and A → C is true at all worlds if A is impossible).
18 syls
checking: I spoke loosely of "the" Stalnaker conditional, but henceforth it will be better to speak in the plural of the Stalnaker conditionals for various methods of revising worlds.
18 syls
checking: We are interested only in those methods of revision, for worlds and for probability functions, that can be regarded as giving revisions that are in some reasonable sense minimal.
18 syls
checking: We have no hope of saying in any precise way just which methods those are, but at least we can list some formal requirements that such a method must satisfy.
18 syls
checking: The requirements were given by Stalnaker for revision of worlds, but they carry over mutatis mutandis to revision of probability functions also.
18 syls
checking: First, a minimal revision to reach some goal must be one that does reach it.
18 syls
checking: For worlds, W A must be a world where A is true; for probability functions, P A must assign to A a probability of 1.
20 syls
checking: Second, there must be no revision when none is needed.
14 syls
checking: For worlds, if A is already true at W then W A must be W itself; for probability functions, if P(A) is already 1, then P A must be P. Third, the method must be consistent in its comparisons.
18 syls
checking: For worlds, if B is true at W A and A is true at W B then W A and W B must be the same; else W A would be treated as both less and more of a revision of W than is W B .
19 syls
checking: Likewise for probability functions, if P A (B) and P B (A) both are 1, then P A and P B must be the same.
18 syls
checking: Let us call any method of revision of worlds or of probability functions eligible iff it satisfies these three requirements.
20 syls
checking: We note that the methods of revising probability functions that we have considered are indeed eligible.
18 syls
checking: Conditionalizing is an eligible method; or, more precisely, conditionalizing can be extended to an eligible method applicable to any probability function P and any possible A. (Choose some fixed arbitrary well-ordering of all probability functions.
error
checking: In case P A cannot be obtained by conditionalizing because P(A) is zero, let it be the first, according to the arbitrary ordering, of the probability functions that assign to A a probability of 1.
error
checking: ) Imaging is also an eligible method.
13 syls
checking: More precisely, imaging on the basis of any eligible method of revising worlds is an eligible method of revising probability functions.
18 syls
checking: Our theorem of the previous section may be restated as follows.
19 syls
checking: If end p.150 → is a Stalnaker conditional for any eligible method of revising worlds, then → is also a probability-revision conditional for an eligible method of revising probability functions; namely, for the method that works by imaging on the basis of the given method of revising worlds.
error
checking: Now we shall prove the converse: if → is a probability-revision conditional for an eligible method of revising probability functions, then → is also a Stalnaker conditional for an eligible method of revising worlds.
18 syls
checking: In short, the probability-revision conditionals are exactly the Stalnaker conditionals.
error
checking: Suppose that we have some eligible method of revising probability functions; and suppose that → is a probability-revision conditional for this method.
21 syls
checking: We shall need to find a method of revising worlds; therefore let us consider the revision of certain special probability functions that stand in one-to-one correspondence with the worlds.
20 syls
checking: For each world W, there is a probability function P that gives all the probability to W and none to any other world.
18 syls
checking: Accordingly, by (17), (21) P(A) = {1 if A is true at W; 0 if A is false at W} = W(A) for any sentence A. Call such a probability function opinionated, since it would represent the beliefs of someone who was absolutely certain that the world W was actual and who therefore held a firm opinion about every question; and call the world W where P concentrates all the probability the belief world of P. Our given method of revising probability functions preserves opinionation.
error
checking: Suppose P were opinionated and P A were not, for some possible A. That is to say that P A gives positive probability  to two or more worlds.
19 syls
checking: We have assumed that our language has the means to distinguish the worlds, so there is some sentence C such that P A (C) is neither 0 nor 1.
18 syls
checking: But since P is opinionated, P(A → C) is either 0 or 1, contradicting the hypothesis that → is a probability-revision conditional so that P A (C) and P(A → C) are equal.
error
checking: Then we have the following method of revising worlds.
14 syls
checking: Given a world W and possible sentence A, let P be the opinionated probability function with belief world W, revise P according to our given method of revising probability functions, and let W A be the belief world of the resulting opinionated probability function P A .
18 syls
checking: Since the given method of revising probability functions is eligible, so is this derived method of revising worlds.
18 syls
checking: Consider any world W and sentences A and C. Let P be the opinionated end p.151 probability function with belief world W, and let W A be as above.
18 syls
checking: Then if A is possible, (22) W(A → C) = P(A → C), by (21); = PA(C), by (20); = WA(C), by (21) applied to WA.
error
processed: 3000
checking: So → is a Stalnaker conditional for the derived method of revising worlds.
20 syls
checking: Quod erat demonstrandum.
error
checking: 13 Postscript to "Probabilities of Conditionals and Conditional Probabilities" Indicative Conditionals Better Explained I retract the positive theory of indicative conditionals that I proposed in the paper.
error
checking: I now prefer the alternative theory advanced by Frank Jackson.
17 syls
added: I now prefer the alternative theory advanced by Frank Jackson.
checking: 1 The two theories have much in common.
error
checking: Both agree (1) that the indicative conditional has the truth conditions of the truth-functional conditional A ⊃ C, yet (2) its assertability goes by the conditional subjective probability P(C/A), provided that we abstract from special considerations— of etiquette, say—that apply in special cases.
error
checking: Both theories further agree, therefore, (3) that there is a discrepancy between truth- and assertability-preserving inference involving indicative conditionals; and (4) that our intuitions about valid reasoning with conditionals end p.152 are apt to concern the latter, and so to be poor evidence about the former.
error
checking: (As to whether "validity" should be the word for truth- or for assertability-preservation, that seems a non-issue if ever there was one.
error
checking: ) Further, the theories agree (5) that the discrepancy between the assertability P(C/A) and the probability of truth P(A ⊃ C) is due to some sort of Gricean implicature, and (6) that an adequate account of this implicature must use the premise that the conditional has the truth conditions of A ⊃ C. I still hold these six theses.
error
checking: But what sort of implicature is involved?
error
checking: Formerly, I thought it was predominantly a conversational implicature, akin to the implicature from "Here, you have a good point" to "Elsewhere, you mostly don't".
18 syls
checking: According to Jackson, it is a conventional implicature, akin to the implicature from "She votes Liberal but she's no fool" to "Liberal voters mostly are fools".
error
checking: I said, following Grice: if P(A ⊃ C) is high mostly because P(A) is low, what's the sense of saying A ⊃ C?
18 syls
checking: Why not say the stronger thing that's almost as probable, not-A?
17 syls
added: Why not say the stronger thing that's almost as probable, not-A?
checking: If you say the weaker thing, you will be needlessly uninformative.
18 syls
checking: Besides, you will mislead those who rely on you not to be needlessly uninformative, and who will infer that you were not in a position to say the stronger thing.
18 syls
checking: To which Jackson replies that we often do say weaker things than we believe true, and for a very good reason.
19 syls
checking: I speak to you (or to my future self, via memory) in the expectation that our belief systems will be much alike, but not exactly alike.
21 syls
checking: If there were too little in common, my attempts to convey information would fail; if there were too much in common, they would serve no purpose.
19 syls
checking: I do not know quite what other information you (or I in future) may possess from other sources.
18 syls
checking: Maybe you (or I in future) know something that now seems to me improbable.
20 syls
checking: I would like  to say something that will be useful even so.
15 syls
checking: So let me not say the strongest thing I believe.
12 syls
checking: Let me say something a bit weaker, if I can thereby say something that will not need to be given up, that will remain useful, even if a certain hypothesis that I now take to be improbable should turn out to be the case.
18 syls
checking: If I say something that I would continue to believe even if I should learn that the improbable hypothesis is true, then that will be something that I think you can take my word for even if you already believe the hypothesis.
18 syls
checking: Let us say that A is robust with respect to B (according to someone's subjective probabilities at a certain time) iff the unconditional probability of A and the probability of A conditionally on B are close together, and both are high; so that even if one were to learn that B, end p.153 one would continue to find A probable.
19 syls
checking: Then Jackson's point is that one might say the weaker thing rather than the stronger for the sake of robustness.
18 syls
checking: The weaker might be more robust with respect to some case that one judges to be improbable, but that one nevertheless does not wish to ignore.
18 syls
checking: If it is pointless to say the weaker instead of the stronger, how much more pointless to say the weaker and the stronger both!
18 syls
checking: And yet we do.
4 syls
checking: I might say: "Bruce is asleep in the rag box, or anyway somewhere downstairs".
19 syls
checking: Jackson can explain that.
6 syls
checking: There's point in saying the stronger, and there's point in saying the more robust, and they're different, so I say them both.
18 syls
checking: It could be useful to point out that one is saying something robust.
17 syls
added: It could be useful to point out that one is saying something robust.
checking: One might say: "I am saying A not because I do not believe anything stronger, but because I want to say something which is robust with respect to B—something you may rely on even if, unlike me, you believe that B." But that's clumsy.
19 syls
checking: It would be a good idea if we had conventional devices to signal robustness more concisely.
18 syls
checking: So it would be no surprise to find out that we do.
13 syls
checking: Jackson suggests that we have various such devices, and that the indicative conditional construction is one of them.
21 syls
checking: An indicative conditional is a truth-functional conditional that conventionally implicates robustness with respect to the antecedent.
19 syls
checking: Therefore, an indicative conditional with antecedent A and consequent C is assertable iff (or to the extent that) the probabilities P(A ⊃ C) and P(A ⊃ C/A) both are high.
18 syls
checking: If the second is high, the first will be too; and the second is high iff P(C/A) is high; and that is the reason why the assertability of indicative conditionals goes by the corresponding conditional probability.
error
checking: Jackson lists several advantages of his implicature-of-robustness theory over my assert-thestronger theory.
error
checking: I will mention only one (which is not to suggest that I find the rest unpersuasive).
18 syls
checking: I can say: "Fred will not study, and if he does he still won't pass".
17 syls
added: I can say: "Fred will not study, and if he does he still won't pass".
checking: If the conditional is assertable only when the denial of its antecedent is not, as the assert-the-stronger theory predicts, then how can it happen that the conditional and the denial of its antecedent both are assertable?
error
checking: As already noted, Jackson can explain such things.
13 syls
checking: The conditional was added for the sake of robustness, so that even if you happen to think I'm wrong about Fred not studying, you can still take my word for it that if he studies he still won't pass.
19 syls
checking: So far, I have just been retailing Jackson.
11 syls
checking: But I think that one complication ought to be added.
14 syls
checking: (Jackson tells me that he agrees.
8 syls
checking: ) Above, I end p.154 introduced robustness by what was in effect a double definition: first in terms of probability, then in terms of what would happen if something were learned.
error
checking: Let us distinguish more carefully: A is robust 1 with respect to B iff P(A) and P(A/B) are close, and both are high.
error
checking: A is robust 2 with respect to B iff P(A) is high, and would remain high even if one were to learn that B. Robustness 1 is robustness as Jackson officially defines it; and it is the implicature of robustness 1 that explains why assertability of conditionals goes by conditional probability.
error
checking: But our reasons for wanting to say what's robust, and for needing signals of robustness, seem to apply to robustness 2 .
18 syls
checking: Most of the time, fortunately, the distinction doesn't matter.
error
checking: Suppose that if one were to learn that B, one would learn only that B, and nothing else (or nothing else relevant).
18 syls
checking: And suppose that one would then revise one's beliefs by conditionalizing.
error
checking: Then we have robustness 2 of  A with respect to B iff we have robustness 1 .
error
checking: In this normal case, the distinction makes no difference.
14 syls
checking: However, there may be abnormal cases: cases in which B could not be learned all by itself, but would have to be accompanied by some extra information E. Suppose A is robust 1 with respect to B alone; but not with respect to B and E in conjunction.
18 syls
checking: Then A will not be robust 2 with respect to B. Example: A is "I'll never believe that Reagan works for the KGB"; B is "Reagan works for the KGB"; and E is not-A.
error
checking: My thought is that if the KGB were successful enough to install their man as president, surely they'd also be successful enough to control the news completely.
error
checking: So P(A) and P(A/B) are both high; but of course P(A/BE) = 0.
error
checking: Yet if I did learn that Reagan worked for the KGB, I'd ipso facto learn that I believed it—despite my prior expectation that the KGB would be able to keep me from suspecting.
error
checking: So A is not at all robust 2 with respect to B.2 When the two senses of robustness come apart in special cases, which one does the indicative conditional signal?
error
checking: What really matters is robustness 2 , so it would be more useful to signal that.
error
checking: On the other end p.155 hand, it would be much easier to signal robustness 1 .
error
checking: Robustness 2 with respect to B amounts roughly to robustness 1 with respect to the whole of what would be learned if B were learned.
error
checking: (The two are equivalent under the assumption that the learner would conditionalize.
18 syls
checking: ) But it might be no easy thing to judge what would be learned if B were learned, in view of the variety of ways that something might be learned.
18 syls
checking: For the most part, robustness 1 is a reasonable guide to the robustness 2 that really matters—a fallible guide, as we've seen, but pretty good most of the time.
error
checking: So it's unsurprising if what we have the means to signal is the former rather than the latter.
18 syls
checking: And if this gets conventionalized, it should be unsurprising to find that we signal robustness 1 even when that clearly diverges from robustness 2 .
error
checking: That is exactly what happens.
8 syls
checking: Example: I can perfectly well say "If Reagan works for the KGB, I'll never believe it".
error
checking: end p.156 Part Six Causation end p.157 end p.158 Twenty-One Causation* Hume defined causation twice over.
error
checking: He wrote "we may define a cause to be an object followed by another, and where all the objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the second.
19 syls
checking: Or, in other words, where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed".
19 syls
checking: 1 Descendants of Hume's first definition still dominate the philosophy of causation: a casual succession is supposed to be a succession that instantiates a regularity.
error
checking: To be sure, there have been improvements.
9 syls
checking: Nowadays we try to distinguish the regularities that count—the "causal laws"—from mere accidental regularities of succession.
error
checking: We subsume causes and effects under regularities by means of descriptions they satisfy, not by over-all similarity.
error
checking: And we allow a cause to be only one indispensable part, not the whole, of the total situation that is followed by the effect in accordance with a law.
18 syls
checking: In present-day regularity analyses, a cause is defined (roughly) as any member of any minimal set of actual conditions that are jointly sufficient, given the laws, for the existence of the effect.
18 syls
checking: More precisely, let C be the proposition that c exists (or occurs) and end p.159 let E be the proposition that e exists.
19 syls
checking: Then c causes e, according to a typical regularity analysis,2 iff (1) C and E are true; and (2) for some nonempty set of true law-propositions and some set of true propositions of particular fact, and jointly imply C ⊃ E, although and jointly do not imply E and alone does not imply C ⊃ E.3 Much needs doing, and much has been done, to turn definitions like this one into defensible analyses.
18 syls
checking: Many problems have been overcome.
9 syls
checking: Others remain: in particular, regularity analyses  tend to confuse causation itself with various other causal relations.
18 syls
checking: If c belongs to a minimal set of conditions jointly sufficient for e, given the laws, then c may well be a genuine cause of e. But c might rather be an effect of e: one which could not, given the laws and some of the actual circumstances, have occurred otherwise than by being caused by e. Or c might be an epiphenomenon of the causal history of e: a more or less inefficacious effect of some genuine cause of e. Or c might be a preempted potential cause of e: something that did not cause e, but that would have done so in the absence of whatever really did cause e. It remains to be seen whether any regularity analysis can succeed in distinguishing genuine causes from effects, epiphenomena, and preempted potential causes—and whether it can succeed without falling victim to worse problems, without piling on the epicycles, and without departing from the fundamental idea that causation is instantiation of regularities.
19 syls
checking: I have no proof that regularity analyses are beyond repair, nor any space to review the repairs that have been tried.
19 syls
checking: Suffice it to say that the prospects look dark.
11 syls
checking: I think it is time to give up and try something else.
13 syls
checking: A promising alternative is not far to seek.
13 syls
checking: Hume's "other words"—that if the cause had not been, the effect never had existed—are no mere restatement of his first definition.
18 syls
checking: They propose something altogether different: a counterfactual analysis of causation.
error
checking: The proposal has not been well received.
10 syls
checking: True, we do know that causation has something or other to do with counterfactuals.
error
checking: We think end p.160 of a cause as something that makes a difference, and the difference it makes must be a difference from what would have happened without it.
error
checking: Had it been absent, its effects—some of them, at least, and usually all—would have been absent as well.
18 syls
checking: Yet it is one thing to mention these platitudes now and again, and another thing to rest an analysis on them.
20 syls
checking: That has not seemed worth while.
6 syls
checking: 4 We have learned all too well that counterfactuals are ill understood, wherefore it did not seem that much understanding could be gained by using them to analyze causation or anything else.
error
checking: Pending a better understanding of counterfactuals, moreover, we had no way to fight seeming counterexamples to a counterfactual analysis.
error
checking: But counterfactuals need not remain ill understood, I claim, unless we cling to false preconceptions about what it would be like to understand them.
error
checking: Must an adequate understanding make no reference to unactualized possibilities?
error
checking: Must it assign sharply determinate truth conditions?
14 syls
checking: Must it connect counterfactuals rigidly to covering laws?
error
checking: Then none will be forthcoming.
7 syls
checking: So much the worse for those standards of adequacy.
13 syls
checking: Why not take counterfactuals at face value: as statements about possible alternatives to the actual situation, somewhat vaguely specified, in which the actual laws may or may not remain intact?
error
checking: There are now several such treatments of counterfactuals, differing only in details.
error
checking: 5 If they are right, then sound foundations have been laid for analyses that use counterfactuals.
error
checking: In this paper, I shall state a counterfactual analysis, not very different from Hume's second definition, of some sorts of causation.
error
checking: Then I shall try to show how this analysis works to distinguish genuine causes from effects, epiphenomena, and preempted potential causes.
20 syls
checking: My discussion will be incomplete in at least four ways.
14 syls
checking: Explicit preliminary settings-aside may prevent confusion.
18 syls
checking: 1.
error
checking: I shall confine myself to causation among events, in the everyday sense of the word: flashes, battles, conversations, impacts, strolls, deaths, touchdowns, falls, kisses, and the like.
19 syls
checking: Not that events are the only things that can cause or be caused; but I have no full list of the others, and no good umbrella-term to cover them all.
18 syls
checking: 2.
error
checking: My analysis is meant to apply to causation in particular cases.
19 syls
checking: It end p.161 is not an analysis of causal generalizations.
error
checking: Presumably those are quantified statements involving causation among particular events (or non-events), but it turns out not to be easy to match up the causal generalizations of natural language with the available quantified forms.
19 syls
checking: A sentence of the form "c -events cause e -events," for instance, can mean any of  (a) For some c in c and some e in e , c causes e. (b) For every e in e , there is some c in c such that c causes e. (c) For every c in c , there is some e in e such that c causes e. not to mention further ambiguities.
18 syls
checking: Worse still, "Only c -events cause e -events" ought to mean (d) For every c, if there is some e in e such that c causes e, then c is in c .
19 syls
checking: if "only" has its usual meaning.
10 syls
checking: But no; it unambiguously means (b) instead!
13 syls
checking: These problems are not about causation, but about our idioms of quantification.
18 syls
checking: 3.
error
checking: We sometimes single out one among all the causes of some event and call it "the" cause, as if there were no others.
18 syls
checking: Or we single out a few as the "causes," calling the rest mere "causal factors" or "causal conditions".
18 syls
checking: Or we speak of the "decisive" or "real" or "principal" cause.
15 syls
checking: We may select the abnormal or extraordinary causes, or those under human control, or those we deem good or bad, or just those we want to talk about.
18 syls
checking: I have nothing to say about these principles of invidious discrimination.
22 syls
checking: 6 I am concerned with the prior question of what it is to be one of the causes (unselectively speaking).
error
checking: My analysis is meant to capture a broad and nondiscriminatory concept of causation.
20 syls
checking: 4.
error
checking: I shall be content, for now, if I can give an analysis of causation that works properly under determinism.
20 syls
checking: By determinism I do not mean any thesis of universal causation, or universal predictability-in-principle, but rather this: the prevailing laws of nature are such that there do not exist any two possible worlds which are exactly alike up to some time, which differ thereafter, and in which those laws are never violated.
19 syls
checking: Perhaps by ignoring indeterminism I squander the most striking advantage of a counterfactual analysis over a regularity analysis: end p.162 that it allows undetermined events to be caused.
error
checking: 7 I fear, however, that my present analysis cannot yet cope with all varieties of causation under indeterminism.
error
checking: The needed repair would take us too far into disputed questions about the foundations of probability.
19 syls
checking: Comparative Similarity To begin, I take as primitive a relation of comparative over-all similarity among possible worlds.
18 syls
checking: We may say that one world is closer to actuality than another if the first resembles our actual world more than the second does, taking account of all the respects of similarity and difference and balancing them off one against another.
19 syls
checking: (More generally, an arbitrary world w can play the role of our actual world.
18 syls
checking: In speaking of our actual world without knowing just which world is ours, I am in effect generalizing over all worlds.
18 syls
checking: We really need a three-place relation: world w 1 is closer to world w than world w 2 is.
error
checking: I shall henceforth leave this generality tacit.
13 syls
checking: ) I have not said just how to balance the respects of comparison against each other, so I have not said just what our relation of comparative similarity is to be.
19 syls
checking: Not for nothing did I call it primitive.
11 syls
checking: But I have said what sort of relation it is, and we are familiar with relations of that sort.
18 syls
checking: We do make judgments of comparative overall similarity—of people, for instance—by balancing off many respects of similarity and difference.
18 syls
checking: Often our mutual expectations about the weighting factors are definite and accurate enough to permit communication.
18 syls
checking: I shall have more to say later about the way the balance must go in particular cases to make my analysis work.
18 syls
checking: But the vagueness of over-all similarity will not be entirely resolved.
20 syls
checking: Nor should it be.
4 syls
checking: The vagueness of similarity does infect causation, and no correct analysis can deny it.
19 syls
checking: The respects of similarity and difference that enter into the over-all similarity of worlds are many and varied.
18 syls
checking: In particular, similarities in matters of particular fact trade off against similarities of law.
18 syls
checking: The prevailing laws of nature are important to the character of a world; so similarities of law  are weighty.
18 syls
checking: Weighty, but not sacred.
6 syls
checking: We should not take it for granted that a world that conforms perfectly to our actual end p.163 laws is ipso facto closer to actuality than any world where those laws are violated in any way at all.
18 syls
checking: It depends on the nature and extent of the violation, on the place of the violated laws in the total system of laws of nature, and on the countervailing similarities and differences in other respects.
18 syls
checking: Likewise, similarities or differences of particular fact may be more or less weighty, depending on their nature and extent.
18 syls
checking: Comprehensive and exact similarities of particular fact throughout large spatio-temporal regions seem to have special weight.
18 syls
checking: It may be worth a small miracle to prolong or expand a region of perfect match.
18 syls
checking: Our relation of comparative similarity should meet two formal constraints.
18 syls
checking: (1) It should be a weak ordering of the worlds: an ordering in which ties are permitted, but any two worlds are comparable.
error
checking: (2) Our actual world should be closest to actuality, resembling itself more than any other world resembles it.
error
checking: We do not impose the further constraint that for any set A of worlds there is a unique closest A-world, or even a set of A-worlds tied for closest.
18 syls
checking: Why not an infinite sequence of closer and closer A-worlds, but no closest?
18 syls
checking: Counterfactuals and Counterfactual Dependence Given any two propositions A and C, we have their counterfactual A → C: the proposition that if A were true, then C would also be true.
error
checking: The operation → is defined by a rule of truth, as follows.
16 syls
checking: A → C is true (at a world w) iff either (1) there are no possible A-worlds (in which case A → C is vacuous), or (2) some A-world where C holds is closer (to w) than is any A-world where C does not hold.
error
checking: In other words, a counterfactual is nonvacuously true iff it takes less of a departure from actuality to make the consequent true along with the antecedent than it does to make the antecedent true without the consequent.
error
checking: We did not assume that there must always be one or more closest A-worlds.
18 syls
checking: But if there are, we can simplify: A → C is nonvacuously true iff C holds at all the closest A-worlds.
error
checking: We have not presupposed that A is false.
error
checking: If A is true, then our actual world is the closest Aworld, so A → C is true iff C is.
error
checking: Hence A → C implies the material conditional A ⊃ C; and A and C jointly imply A → C. Let A 1 , A 2 , .

16 syls

error
checking: Such exceptions as this, however, do not involve any sort of dependence among distinct particular events.
20 syls
checking: The hope remains that causal dependence among events, at least, may be analyzed simply as counterfactual dependence.
18 syls
checking: end p.165 We have spoken thus far of counterfactual dependence among propositions, not among events.
error
checking: Whatever particular events may be, presumably they are not propositions.
18 syls

18 syls
checking: To any possible event e, there corresponds the proposition O(e) that holds at all and only those worlds where e occurs.

added: Let c and e be two distinct possible particular events.
checking: Then e depends causally on c iff the family O(e), ~O(e) depends counterfactually on the family O(c), ~O(c).
error
checking: As we say it: whether e occurs or not depends on whether c occurs or not.
19 syls
checking: The dependence consists in the truth of two counterfactuals: end p.166 O(c) → O(e) and ~O(c) → ~O(e).
error
checking: There are two cases.
5 syls
checking: If c and e do not actually occur, then the second counterfactual is automatically true because its antecedent and consequent are true: so e depends causally on c iff the first counterfactual holds.
error
checking: That is, iff e would have occurred if c had occurred.
error
checking: But if c and e are actual events, then it is the first counterfactual that is automatically true.
error
checking: Then e depends causally on c iff, if c had not been, e never had existed.
error
checking: I take Hume's second definition as my definition not of causation itself, but of causal dependence among actual events.
18 syls
checking: Causation Causal dependence among actual events implies causation.
20 syls
checking: If c and e are two actual events such that e would not have occurred without c, then c is a cause of e. But I reject the converse.
19 syls
checking: Causation must always be transitive; causal dependence may not be; so there can be causation without causal dependence.
error
checking: Let c, d, and e be three actual events such that d would not have occurred without c and e would not have occurred without d. Then c is a cause of e even if e would still have occurred (otherwise caused) without c. We extend causal dependence to a transitive relation in the usual way.

2 syls
checking: If the C's depend nomically on the A's in virtue of the premise sets and , and if in addition (all members of) and are counterfactually independent of the A's, then it follows that the C's depend counterfactually on the A's.
error
checking: In that case, we may regard the nomic dependence in virtue of and as explaining the counterfactual dependence.
error
checking: Often, perhaps always, counterfactual dependences may be thus explained.
error
checking: But the requirement of counterfactual independence is indispensable.
error
checking: Unless and meet that requirement, nomic dependence in virtue of and does not imply counterfactual dependence, and, if there is counterfactual dependence anyway, does not explain it.

checking: Irreversible counterfactual dependence is shown below: @ is our actual world, the dots are the other worlds, and distance on the page represents similarity "distance".
error
checking: The counterfactuals A 1 → C 1 , A 2 → C 2 , and A 3 → C 3 hold at the actual world; wherefore the C's depend on the A's.
error
checking: But we do not have the reverse dependence of the A's on the AC's, since instead of the needed AC 2 → A 2 and AC 3 → A 3 we have AC 2 → A 1 and AC 3 →A1.
19 syls
checking: Just such irreversibility is commonplace.
error
checking: The barometer reading end p.168 depends counterfactually on the pressure—that is as clear-cut as counterfactuals ever get— but does the pressure depend counterfactually on the reading?
error
checking: If the reading had been higher, would the pressure have been higher?
16 syls
checking: Or would the barometer have been malfunctioning?
13 syls
checking: The second sounds better: a higher reading would have been an incorrect reading.
18 syls
checking: To be sure, there are actual laws and circumstances that imply and explain the actual accuracy of the barometer, but these are no more sacred than the actual laws and circumstances that imply and explain the actual pressure.
18 syls
checking: Less sacred, in fact.
5 syls
checking: When something must give way to permit a higher reading, we find it less of a departure from actuality to hold the pressure fixed and sacrifice the accuracy, rather than vice versa.
18 syls
checking: It is not hard to see why.
7 syls
checking: The barometer, being more localized and more delicate than the weather, is more vulnerable to slight departures from actuality.
18 syls
checking: 10 We can now explain why regularity analyses of causation (among events, under determinism) work as well as they do.
error
checking: Suppose that event c causes event e according to the sample regularity analysis that I gave at the beginning of this paper, in virtue of premise sets and .
18 syls
checking: It  follows that , and ~O(c) jointly do not imply O(e).
15 syls
checking: Strengthen this: suppose further that they do imply ~O(e).
14 syls
checking: If so, the family O(e), ~O(e) depends nomically on the family O(c), ~O(c) in virtue of and .
error
checking: Add one more supposition: that and are counterfactually independent of O(c), ~O(c).
error
checking: Then it follows according to my counterfactual analysis that e depends counterfactually and causally on c, and hence that c causes e. If I am right, the regularity analysis gives conditions that are almost but not quite sufficient for explicable causal dependence.
error
checking: That is not quite the same thing as causation; but causation without causal dependence is scarce, and if there is inexplicable causal dependence we are (understandably!
19 syls
checking: ) unaware of it.
5 syls
checking: 11 end p.169 Effects and Epiphenomena I return now to the problems I raised against regularity analyses, hoping to show that my counterfactual analysis can overcome them.
error
checking: The problem of effects, as it confronts a counterfactual analysis, is as follows.
error
checking: Suppose that c causes a subsequent event e, and that e does not also cause c. (I do not rule out closed causal loops a priori, but this case is not to be one.
18 syls
checking: ) Suppose further that, given the laws and some of the actual circumstances, c could not have failed to cause e. It seems to follow that if the effect e had not occurred, then its cause c would not have occurred.
20 syls
checking: We have a spurious reverse causal dependence of c on e, contradicting our supposition that e did not cause c. The problem of epiphenomena, for a counterfactual analysis, is similar.
21 syls
checking: Suppose that e is an epiphenomenal effect of a genuine cause c of an effect f. That is, c causes first e and then f, but e does not cause f. Suppose further that, given the laws and some of the actual circumstances, c could not have failed to cause e; and that, given the laws and others of the circumstances, f could not have been caused otherwise than by c. It seems to follow that if the epiphenomenon e had not occurred, then its cause c would not have occurred and the further effect f of that same cause would not have occurred either.
error
checking: We have a spurious causal dependence of f on e, contradicting our supposition that e did not cause f. One might be tempted to solve the problem of effects by brute force: insert into the analysis a stipulation that a cause must always precede its effect (and perhaps a parallel stipulation for causal dependence).
19 syls
checking: I reject this solution.
7 syls
checking: (1) It is worthless against the closely related problem of epiphenomena, since the epiphenomenon e does precede its spurious effect f. (2) It rejects a priori certain legitimate physical hypotheses that posit backward or simultaneous causation.
error
checking: (3) It trivializes any theory that seeks to define the forward direction of time as the predominant direction of causation.
error
checking: The proper solution to both problems, I think, is flatly to deny the counterfactuals that cause the trouble.
18 syls
checking: If e had been absent, it is not that c would have been absent (and with it f, in the second case).
18 syls
checking: Rather, c would have occurred just as it did but would have failed to cause e. It is less of a departure from actuality to get rid of e by holding c fixed and giving up some or other of the laws and circumstances in virtue of which c could not have failed to cause e, rather than to hold those laws and circumstances fixed and get rid of e by going back and abolishing its cause c. (In the second case, it would of course be pointless end p.170 not to hold f fixed along with c.) The causal dependence of e on c is the same sort of irreversible counterfactual dependence that we have considered already.
18 syls
checking: To get rid of an actual event e with the least over-all departure from actuality, it will normally be best not to diverge at all from the actual course of events until just before the time of e. The longer we wait, the more we prolong the spatiotemporal region of perfect match between our actual world and the selected alternative.
20 syls
checking: Why diverge sooner rather than later?
10 syls
added:  I reject this solution. Why diverge sooner rather than later?
checking: Not to avoid violations of laws of nature.
13 syls
checking: Under determinism any divergence, soon or late, requires some violation of the actual laws.
18 syls
checking: If the laws were held sacred, there would be no way to get rid of e without changing all of the past; and nothing guarantees that the change could be kept negligible except in the recent past.
19 syls
checking: That would mean that if the present were ever so slightly different, then all  of the past would have been different—which is absurd.
18 syls
checking: So the laws are not sacred.
7 syls
checking: Violation of laws is a matter of degree.
13 syls
checking: Until we get up to the time immediately before e is to occur, there is no general reason why a later divergence to avert e should need a more severe violation than an earlier one.
18 syls
checking: Perhaps there are special reasons in special cases—but then these may be cases of backward causal dependence.
18 syls
checking: Preemption Suppose that c 1 occurs and causes e; and that c 2 also occurs and does not cause e, but would have caused e if c 1 had been absent.
error
checking: Thus c 2 is a potential alternate cause of e, but is preempted by the actual cause c 1 .
error
checking: We may say that c 1 and c 2 overdetermine e, but they do so asymmetrically.
error
checking: 12 In virtue of what difference does c 1 but not c 2 cause e?
error
checking: As far as causal dependence goes, there is no difference: e depends neither on c 1 nor on c 2 .
18 syls
checking: If either one had not occurred, the other would have sufficed to cause e. So the difference must be that, thanks to c 1 , there is no causal chain from c 2 to e; whereas there is a causal chain of two or more steps from c 1 to e. Assume for simplicity that two steps are enough.
18 syls
checking: Then e depends causally on some intermediate event d, end p.171 and d in turn depends on c 1 .
error
checking: Causal dependence is here intransitive: c 1 causes e via d even though e would still have occurred without c 1 .
error
checking: So far, so good.
4 syls
added:  Violation of laws is a matter of degree. So far, so good.
checking: It remains only to deal with the objection that e does not depend causally on d, because if d had been absent then c 1 would have been absent and c 2 , no longer preempted, would have caused e. We may reply by denying the claim that if d had been absent then c 1 would have been absent.
18 syls
checking: That is the very same sort of spurious reverse dependence of cause on effect that we have just rejected in simpler cases.
18 syls
checking: I rather claim that if d had been absent, c 1 would somehow have failed to cause d. But c 1 would still have been there to interfere with c 2 , so e would not have occurred.
error
checking: Postscripts to "Causation" A. Piecemeal Causation Suppose that c and e are large, prolonged processes, each composed of many smaller events.
18 syls
checking: Suppose it is not true (or not clearly true) that e, taken as a whole, causally depends on c, taken as a whole; suppose even that they are not connected by a chain of causal dependence.
18 syls
checking: It may nevertheless be that c and e are divisible into parts in such a way that every part of e is causally dependent on (or connected by a chain of causal dependence to) some part of c. In that case we might well simply speak of c as a cause of e, though it is not so under the analysis I gave.
18 syls
checking: Self-sustaining processes exhibit piecemeal causation.
15 syls
checking: For instance, suppose a public address system is turned up until it howls from feedback.
18 syls
checking: The howling, from start to finish, is an event.
12 syls
checking: If it had not occurred, it would not have occurred; but this is certainly not counterfactual dependence between distinct events, therefore it does not qualify as causal dependence on my account.
18 syls
checking: Nor is there a closed causal loop, as in time travel stories, in which the howling causes itself because it depends causally on some distinct event which in turn depends causally on it.
18 syls
checking: So it is not true, on my account, that the howling taken as a whole causes itself.
18 syls
checking: What is true is that the howling end p.172 causes itself piecemeal.
error
checking: It is divisible into parts in such a way that each part except the first is caused by an earlier part, and each part except the last causes a later part.
18 syls
checking: This causing of part by part is unproblematic: cause and effect are distinct events, wherefore their counterfactual dependence qualifies as causal.
error
checking: We might well say that the howling causes itself; this is to be accepted, but only in a derivative sense.
19 syls
checking: Similarly, if two prolonged events sustain one another,  each causes the other piecemeal.
19 syls
checking: The example of the howling illustrates this case also: the sound in the air sustains the signal in the wires, and vice versa.
18 syls
checking: It may be that when we speak of causation in history we are often speaking of piecemeal causation.
19 syls
checking: 1 A depression causes a wave of bankruptcies: what are we to make of this?
error
checking: If the depression had not occurred.
9 syls
checking: .
0 syls

0 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: That is puzzling.
5 syls
checking: To suppose away an entire depression takes us a long way from actuality.
18 syls
checking: And the farther we depart from actuality, the more we lose control over our counterfactuals.
19 syls
checking: For the more different respects of similarity and difference we have to balance, the more of a problem it is that we have left it vague just how to do the balancing, so the less clearly we know what is and what isn't to be held fixed in our counterfactualizing.
18 syls
checking: (For instance, what if many of the firms that went broke came into existence during, and because of, the depression itself?
19 syls
checking: Shall we hold their existence fixed in asking what would have happened without the depression?
18 syls
checking: ) But the depression is a big event that is divisible into many parts.
18 syls
checking: Although it is hard to say what would happened without the entire depression, it is comparatively easy to say that without this or that event which was part of the depression, this or that one of the bankruptcies would not have taken place.
20 syls
checking: Now, our counterfactuals are much more under control, because they stay much closer to home.
error
checking: So even if it is unclear what the depression taken as a whole might have caused, it is at any rate clear that various parts of it caused the various bankruptcies.
18 syls
checking: That is to say that the depression was at least a piecemeal cause of the wave of bankruptcies.
18 syls
checking: There is a well-known dilemma about actions.
12 syls
checking: Consider an action of raising my arm.
11 syls
checking: First something goes on within my brain; then signals go out my nerves; then my muscles contract; and as they do, my arm rises.
18 syls
checking: There seems to be a conflict between two things we want to say.
15 syls
checking: (1) The action of raising my arm is a prolonged event with diverse parts.
error
checking: It is the whole causal process just described.
11 syls
checking: It may begin within end p.173 me, but it is not over until my arm rises.
error
checking: Its earlier parts cause its later parts, and its final part is the bodily movement.
20 syls
checking: But (2) just as my action of raising a flag would be an event that causes a flag to rise, so my action of raising my arm is an event that causes my arm to rise.
error
checking: The raising, whether of flag or of arm, is so-called because it causes the rising.
18 syls
checking: Distinguish the inclusion of one event in another from mere involvement of one in the naming of the other.
20 syls
checking: So far as involvement in naming goes, the two cases are on a par.
18 syls
checking: For the flag and the arm alike, the raising deserves its name only if, and perhaps only after, a rising ensues.
18 syls
checking: But with respect to inclusion, the two cases seem to differ.
16 syls
checking: If I raise a flag by delayed action, I can be done raising it long before it rises.
18 syls
checking: My action is over when I have done my part; the process that ends when the flag is up consists of more than just my action.
18 syls
checking: (Beware ambiguity: the phrase "my raising the flag" might denote just my action, or it might denote the whole affair.
18 syls
checking: ) But if I raise my arm by delayed action—say that I have very sluggish nerves—then it takes me a long time to raise my arm.
19 syls
checking: In this case, my part of the process is the whole of the process.
16 syls
checking: So long as the signal is traveling through my sluggish nerves, so long as my muscles are contracting and my arm is rising, my part of the affair is still going on.
18 syls
checking: I would like to assent to both (1) and (2); the apparent obstacle is that we have two events, the raising and the rising, and according to (1) they are not wholly distinct, yet according to (2) one causes the other.
error
checking: But if this is a case of piecemeal causation, we have no problem.
17 syls
added: But if this is a case of piecemeal causation, we have no problem.
checking: If an early part of the raising causes the rising which is a late part of the raising, we may still say simply that the raising causes the rising; just as, when an early part of the depression causes a bankruptcy which is a later part of the depression, we may still say simply that the depression causes the bankruptcy.
18 syls
checking: There is a second version of the problem.
11 syls
checking: The rising of my arm is not the only event which is caused by the initial inner part of my action and yet takes place before my arm has risen.
18 syls
checking: The same may be true of various side effects, events which definitely are not to be included as parts of the action.
19 syls
checking: Suppose, for instance, that the nerves leading into my arm are monitored so that whenever I raise my arm the nerve signal produces a trace on an oscillograph.
18 syls
checking: Because I can produce the trace by raising my arm, we ought to be free to say that my action causes the trace.
18 syls
checking: And  yet the trace appears before the arm rises.
12 syls
checking: Shall we say that the effect precedes its cause?
11 syls
checking: Or that the action which causes the effect is over sooner than we think?
18 syls
checking: Neither: it is a case of piecemeal end p.174 causation.
error
checking: Like the rising of the arm, the trace on the oscillograph is caused by an initial part of the action, and thereby is caused by the action.
error
checking: 2 B. Chancy Causation In the paper, I confined my discussion to the deterministic case for the sake of brevity.
error
checking: 3 But I certainly do not think that causation requires determinism.
error
checking: (Hence I regard "causality" as a naughty word, since it is ambiguous between "causation" and "determinism".
20 syls
checking: ) Events that happen by chance may nevertheless be caused.
14 syls
checking: Indeed, it seems likely that most actual causation is of just this sort.
18 syls
checking: Whether that is so or not, plenty of people do think that our world is chancy; and chancy enough so that most things that happen had some chance, immediately before-hand, of not happening.
18 syls
checking: These people are seldom observed to deny commonplace causal statements, except perhaps when they philosophize.
18 syls
checking: An analysis that imputes widespread error is prima facie implausible.
error
checking: Moreover, it is dishonest to accept it, if you yourself persist in the "error" when you leave the philosophy room.
18 syls
checking: We had better provide for causation under indeterminism, causation of events for which prior conditions were not lawfully sufficient.
error
checking: One kind of chancy causation is already covered by my analysis, with no modification needed: c occurs, e has some chance of occurring, as it happens e does occur; but if c had not occurred, then e would have had no chance at all of occurring, and so would not have occurred.
20 syls
checking: Then e depends causally on c, and c is a cause of e, according to my original analysis.
error
checking: So far, so good.
4 syls
checking: (Some would object to my step from "e would have had no chance of occurring" to "e would not have occurred".
18 syls
checking: They say that things end p.175 with no chance at all of occurring, that is with probability zero, do nevertheless happen; for instance when a fair spinner stops at one angle instead of another, yet any precise angle has probability zero.
error
checking: I think these people are making a rounding error: they fail to distinguish zero chance from infinitesimal chance.
19 syls
checking: Zero chance is no chance, and nothing with zero chance ever happens.
17 syls
added: Zero chance is no chance, and nothing with zero chance ever happens.
checking: The spinner's chance of stopping exactly where it did was not zero; it was infinitesimal, and infinitesimal chance is still some chance.
18 syls
checking: ) But there is a second case to be considered: c occurs, e has some chance x of occurring, and as it happens e does occur; if c had not occurred, e would still have had some chance y of occurring, but only a very slight chance since y would have been very much less than x. We cannot quite say that without the cause, the effect would not have occurred; but we can say that without the cause, the effect would have been very much less probable than it actually was.
18 syls
checking: In this case also, I think we should say that e depends causally on c, and that c is a cause of e. It does not matter whether x itself, the actual chance of the effect, is high or low.
error
checking: Suppose you mischievously hook up a bomb to a randomizer—a genuinely chancy one, if need be one that works by counting clicks in a counter near a radioactive source.
error
checking: If you set the randomizer to a high probability, that makes it likely that your act of setting up the bomb will cause an explosion.
error
checking: If you set the randomizer to a low probability, that makes it less likely that your act will cause an explosion.
error
checking: But no matter how you set the randomizer, if the bomb does chance to go off, then your act does cause the explosion.
error
checking: For no matter how you set the randomizer, we can be sure that the explosion would have been very much less probable still if you hadn't set up the bomb at all.
error
checking: (You took it in stride when you read my words: if you set the randomizer low, that makes it less likely that your act will cause an explosion.
error
checking: That proves my point.
4 syls
checking: For suppose that improbable events cannot be caused: the actual chance x has to be high, or at least has to exceed some lowish threshold, in order to have a case of causation.
18 syls
checking: Then if you set the randomizer low enough, that doesn't just make it unlikely that your act will cause an explosion—it makes it downright  impossible.
error
checking: But "unlikely" did seem the right word.
9 syls
checking: "Don't worry—set the randomizer below 0.
error
checking: 17% and you can't possibly cause an explosion".
error
checking: —Not so!
2 syls
checking: ) Several points of clarification may be helpful.
13 syls
checking: (1) Chances are time-dependent: an event may have different chances at different times end p.176 before it occurs.
error
checking: The actual chance x of e is to be its chance at the time immediately after c; and the counterfactual is to concern chance at that same time.
21 syls
checking: (2) I do not assume that there is some y that would definitely have been the chance of e in the absence of c. Maybe so, maybe not.
error
checking: Maybe in that case the chance of e might have had any of various values, all of them much less than the actual chance x. In saying that without c, e would have had some chance y much less than x, "some chance y" is a quantifier whose scope is limited to the consequent of the conditional.
18 syls
checking: (3) "Much less" means less by a large factor—not by a large difference.
error
processed: 3500
checking: If x is already small, the difference of y and x could not be large.
18 syls
checking: It is x that sets the standard for how small the chance of e must be without c. We could have one case in which the absence of a cause would lower the chance of an effect from 100% to 10%; another in which the lowering would be from 10% to 1%; yet another in which the lowering would be from 1% to 0.
19 syls
checking: 1%; .
error
checking: .
0 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: and all would count equally as cases of chancy causal dependence.
18 syls
checking: So it will not do to simplify our counterfactual and say that without c, the chance of e would be low simpliciter.
error
checking: (4) A chance event may be caused; but we should not say that it is caused to happen rather than not.
error
checking: Contrastive causal statements differ from plain ones.
error
checking: According to what I say about contrastive questions and statements in "Causal Explanation" (in this volume), there can be no contrastive causal explanation of why a chance event occurs rather than not.
error
checking: Many probabilistic theories of causation share the motivating idea that a cause increases the probability of the effect.
error
checking: Mine differs from some of the others in two respects.
13 syls
checking: 4 First, it is meant to apply to causation in the single case: causation by one particular event of another event, not conduciveness of one kind of event to another kind.
error
checking: Hence its probabilities are single-case chances, as opposed to finite or end p.177 limiting frequencies.
19 syls
checking: You may not like single-case chances—I don't either—but I cannot see how to make sense of certain well-established scientific theories without them.
18 syls
checking: If we need them anyway, we may as well use them here.
14 syls
checking: (I discuss single-case chances, and the reason for disliking them, elsewhere in this volume; see "A Subjectivist's Guide to Objective Chance," especially the final section and Postscript C; also my discussion of Humean supervenience in the introduction.
19 syls
checking: ) Second, my analysis is in terms of counterfactual conditionals about probability; not in terms of conditional probabilities.
error
checking: If we try to use an inequality of conditional probabilities to express that event c raises the probability of event e, we run into a well-known difficulty.
21 syls
checking: The inequality may well hold not because c causes e, but rather because c and e are two effects of a common cause.
19 syls
checking: One cure is to use fancier conditional probabilities: conditionalize not just on the absence of c, but on that together with a specification of background.
error
checking: Then the problem is to say, preferably without circular mention of causation, what information should be included in this background.
18 syls
checking: But even if that problem can be solved, another remains.
15 syls
checking: Conditional probabilities, as standardly understood, are quotients.
error
checking: They go undefined if the denominator is zero.
15 syls
checking: If we want to say, using conditional probabilities, that c raises the probability of e, we will need probabilities conditional on the non-occurrence of c (plus background, perhaps).
18 syls
checking: But there is no guarantee that this conditional probability will be defined.
18 syls
checking: What if the probability that c occurs (given background) is one?
18 syls
checking: What if c has been predetermined through all of past time—what if its probability has always been one, so that even by going back in time we cannot find a non-zero chance of c's failing to occur?
22 syls
checking: For that matter, what if we want to apply our probabilistic analysis of causation to a deterministic world in which all probabilities (at all times) are extreme: one for all events that do occur, zero for all that don't?
error
checking: The requisite conditional probabilities will go undefined, and the theory will fall silent.
18 syls
checking: That is not acceptable.
7 syls
checking: Earlier, I said that it would not do to impute error to  indeterminists who accept commonplace causal statements; therefore we cannot accept an analysis of causation that works only under determinism.
error
checking: Likewise it would not do to impute error to determinists who accept commonplace causal statements; therefore we cannot accept an analysis that works only under indeterminism.
error
checking: An adequate analysis must be neutral.
12 syls
checking: It must work in both cases.
7 syls
checking: And it must work in a uniform way, for it does not seem that our concept of causation is disjunctive.
18 syls
checking: A probabilistic analysis (of single-case causation) that uses conditional probabilities is end p.178 not neutral.
error
checking: It is made for indeterminism.
error
checking: My analysis, on the other hand, can serve alike under indeterminism or determinism.
error
checking: 5 My motivating idea is that causes make their effects more probable; but that is written into the analysis of causal dependence, not of causation itself.
error
checking: As in my original analysis, we have causation when we have a causal chain: one or more steps of causal dependence.
18 syls
checking: The effect need not depend on the cause directly.
13 syls
checking: When we have causation without direct causal dependence, as in some cases of preemption, it is not necessarily true that the cause at the beginning of the chain raises the probability of the effect at the end.
18 syls
checking: The cause might lower the probability of the effect, or might leave it unchanged.
18 syls
checking: At each step in the chain, we have a cause raising the probability of its immediate effect.
18 syls
checking: But since counterfactuals are not transitive, that does not settle whether there is raising over the entire chain.
error
checking: Suppose we have two redundant systems to produce the same effect.
17 syls
added: Suppose we have two redundant systems to produce the same effect.
checking: One is much more reliable than the other—that is, much less subject to random failure part way along the causal chain.
18 syls
checking: The reliable system is already started; left to itself, it will very probably produce the effect.
18 syls
checking: But I do not leave it to itself.
9 syls
checking: There is a switch that both turns off the reliable system and turns on the unreliable system, and I throw this switch.
18 syls
checking: As luck would have it, the unreliable system works.
14 syls
checking: The effect ensues, just as it would probably have done without my act.
18 syls
checking: My act did not make the effect more probable, but rather less, since I put the unreliable system in place of the reliable one.
18 syls
checking: Nevertheless, I did cause the effect.
10 syls
checking: And the reason is plain if we consider some intermediate event in the causal chain that actually occurred, something that happened well after the reliable system was already turned off.
19 syls
checking: That event was part of the working of the unreliable system, so it would not have occurred, or at least it would have been improbable, if I had not thrown the switch.
18 syls
checking: But by the time of the intermediate event, the reliable system was already out of action.
18 syls
checking: So without that event, the effect would not have occurred, or at least it would have been very improbable.
18 syls
checking: (Here it is crucial that the counterfactual be governed by a similarity relation that does not conduce to backtracking; see "Counterfactual end p.179 Dependence and Time's Arrow" in this volume.
error
checking: ) My act raised the probability of the intermediate event, and thereby caused it.
18 syls
checking: And the intermediate event raised the probability of the effect, and thereby caused it.
18 syls
checking: So my act caused a cause of the effect, and thereby caused it—despite lowering its probability.
20 syls
checking: 6 I have said that if distinct events c and e both occur, and if the actual chance of e (at a time t immediately after c) is sufficiently greater than the counterfactual chance of e without c, that implies outright that c is a cause of e. Some philosophers find this counterintuitive.
error
checking: They would correct me thus.
6 syls
checking: No; if there would have been some residual chance of e even without c, then the raising of probability only makes it probable that in this case c is a cause of e. Suppose, for instance, that the actual chance of e, with c, was 88%; but that without c, there would still have been a 3% probability of e. Then most likely (probability 97%) this is a case in which e would not have happened without c; then c is indeed a cause of e. But this just might be (probability 3%) a case in which e would have happened anyway; then c is not a cause of e. We can't tell for sure which kind of case this is.
18 syls
checking: It is granted, ex hypothesi, that it would have been a matter of chance whether e occurred.
error
checking: Even so, the objection presupposes that the case must be of one kind or the other: either e definitely would have occurred without c, or it definitely would not have occurred.
18 syls
checking: If that were so, then indeed it would be sensible to say that we have causation only in case e definitely would not have occurred  without c. My original analysis would serve, the amendment suggested in this postscript would be unwise, and instead of having a plain case of probabilistic causation we would have a probable case of plain causation.
18 syls
checking: But I reject the presupposition that there are two different ways the world could be, giving us one definite counterfactual or the other.
18 syls
checking: That presupposition is a metaphysical burden quite out of proportion to its intuitive appeal; what is more, its intuitive appeal can be explained away.
18 syls
checking: The presupposition is that there is some hidden feature which may or may not be present in our actual world, and which if present would end p.180 make true the counterfactual that e would have occurred anyway without c. If this counterfactual works as others do, then the only way this hidden feature could make the counterfactual true is by carrying over to the counterfactual situation and there being part of a set of conditions jointly sufficient for e. What sort of set of conditions?
18 syls
checking: We think at once that the set might consist in part of laws of nature, and in part of matters of historical fact prior to the time t, which would together predetermine e. But e cannot be predetermined in the counterfactual situation.
18 syls
checking: For it is supposed to be a matter of chance, in the counterfactual situation as in actuality, whether e occurs.
error
checking: That is stipulated as a hypothesis of the case.
15 syls
checking: When an event is predetermined, there cannot be any genuine chance that it will not happen.
18 syls
checking: Genuine chance gives us the residue of uncertainty that is left after all laws and prior conditions have been taken into account.
18 syls
checking: (Here I assume that we are not dealing with an extraordinary situation, involving time travel perhaps, in which the normal asymmetries of time break down, and the past contains news from the future.
21 syls
checking: That is fair.
3 syls
checking: The objection concerns what should be said about ordinary cases of probabilistic causation.
18 syls
checking: ) So the hidden feature must be something else.
11 syls
checking: But what else can it be?
6 syls
checking: Not the historical facts prior to t, not the chances, not the laws of nature or the history-to-chance conditionals that say how those chances depend on the prior historical facts.
18 syls
checking: For all those are already taken account of, and they suffice only for a chance and not a certainty of e. There is the rest of history: everything that happens after t. These future historical facts are not relevant to the chances at t; e can still have a chance of not occurring even if there are facts of later history that suffice for its occurrence.
18 syls
checking: As there will be: if it does occur, that is itself a fact of later history.
18 syls
checking: In the terminology of "A Subjectivist's Guide to Objective Chance" (in this volume) later history is "inadmissible".
error
checking: So perhaps that is where the hidden feature of the world is to be found.
18 syls
checking: But this also will not do.
7 syls
checking: For we know very well that if we give weight to future similarities, so that facts of the later history of our world tend to carry over into counterfactual situations, then we will get into trouble.
19 syls
checking: We will get counterfactuals that seem false in themselves, and that also yield false conclusions about causation.
error
checking: We must make sure, either by fiat or else by tailoring our standards of similarity to exploit the de facto asymmetries of time, that future similarities will end p.181 normally carry no weight.
19 syls
checking: (See "Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow" in this volume.
error
checking: ) Features of our actual future history may be well hidden, sure enough, and they might well enter into sets of conditions and laws sufficient to postdetermine e, but what they will not do is carry over into the counterfactual situation without c. (Normally.
18 syls
checking: I am forced to admit exceptions of two kinds, for reasons discussed in Postscript D to "Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow" in this volume.
18 syls
checking: If a reconvergence to actual history could be accomplished without widespread miracles or quasi-miraculous coincidences, then I would admit that actual future history carries over into the counterfactual situation; and I would admit that the absence of such quasi-miracles carries over.
error
checking: But I think the first cannot apply to the truth of counterfactuals at a world like ours, and the second could apply only to the special case where e itself would be quasi-miraculous.
error
checking: So these exceptions are not relevant to our present discussion.
18 syls
checking: )  So the hidden feature must be something else still: not a feature of the history of this world, and also not a feature of its chances, or of the laws or conditionals whereby its chances depend on its history.
18 syls
checking: It fails to supervene on those features of the world on which, so far as we know, all else supervenes.
error
checking: To accept any such mysterious extra feature of the world is a serious matter.
18 syls
checking: We need some reason much more weighty than the isolated intuition on which my opponent relies.
19 syls
checking: 7 Without such a reason, it would be better to suppress the intuition.
error
checking: end p.182 Which is all the easier if it rests on a mistake in the first place; and I think it does.
error
checking: I suspect that my opponent is someone who has not wholeheartedly accepted my stipulation of the case in question.
18 syls
checking: Stipulation or no, he remains at least somewhat inclined to think that the case involves not genuine chance, but a kind of counterfeit chance that is compatible with determinism.
18 syls
checking: (See Postscript B to "A Subjectivist's Guide to Objective Chance" in this volume.
error
checking: ) Perhaps he clearheadedly thinks that counterfeit chance is all the chance there could ever be, and so is all that could be meant by the word "chance".
error
checking: Or perhaps he thinks double, and thinks of the case half one way and half the other.
18 syls
checking: If it is a case of counterfeit chance, then his objection is well taken.
19 syls
checking: For then e is after all predetermined one way or the other, both in actuality and in the counterfactual situation without c; but predetermined partly by details of prior historical fact that are far too minute to be discovered in advance.
18 syls
checking: So we do indeed have an unproblematic hidden feature of the actual world—namely, the relevant configuration of minute details—that carries over to the counterfactual situation and there joins in predetermining the outcome one way or the other.
error
checking: That is all very well, but then his objection is off target.
16 syls
checking: I was not speaking of a case of counterfeit chance, I insist, but of a different case: probabilistic causation of a genuine chance event.
18 syls
checking: If my opponent believes that my case is impossible because counterfeit chance is all the chance there can be, let him say so; but let him not reinterpret my case to fit his own doctrines.
20 syls
checking: When my opponent says that either e would have occurred without c or else e would not have occurred without c, he sounds like Robert Stalnaker.
18 syls
checking: 8 But his position is not the same, though he accepts the same disjunction of counterfactuals, and Stalnaker's defense of such disjunctions is no use to him.
error
checking: My opponent thinks there are two relevant ways the world might be; one of them would make true one of the disjoined counterfactuals, the other would make true the other, so the disjunction is true either way.
18 syls
checking: Stalnaker, like me, thinks there is only one relevant way for the world to be, and it does not make either counterfactual determinately true.
18 syls
checking: But Stalnaker, unlike me, thinks the disjoined counterfactuals are true or false relative to alternative arbitrary resolutions of a semantic indeterminacy; what makes the counterfactuals end p.183 lack determinate truth is that different resolutions go different ways; but every resolution makes one or the other true, so the disjunction is determinately true despite the complementary indeterminacies of its disjuncts.
error
checking: A resolution of an alleged semantic indeterminacy is not a hidden fact about the world; and that is the difference between Stalnaker and my opponent.
error
checking: Stalnaker disagrees with me on a small point of semantics; my opponent, on a large point of ontology.
20 syls
checking: A resolution of an indeterminacy might indeed be mistaken for a hidden fact about the world— Stalnaker suggests, plausibly, that such mistakes are common.
error
checking: So if we accepted Stalnaker's view on the point of semantics, that would give us a second way to explain away my opponent's problematic intuition.
18 syls
checking: C. Insensitive Causation Killing, so they say, is causing to die.
18 syls
checking: I am sure that I—and likewise you, and each of us— have caused ever so many people to die, most of them people yet unborn.
18 syls
checking: Acts of mine are connected to their deaths by long chains of causal dependence.
19 syls
checking: 9 But I have never killed anyone—I hope.
error
checking: For instance, suppose I write a strong recommendation that lands someone a job; so someone else misses out on that job and takes another; which displaces a third job-seeker; this third job-seeker goes elsewhere, and there meets and marries someone; their offspring and all their descendants forevermore would never have lived at all, and a fortiori would never have died, and so presumably their deaths would not have occurred, but for my act.
18 syls
checking: 10 Maybe there is a time after which every death that occurs is one that would not have occurred but for my act.
error
checking: It would be strange to single out my act as the cause of all those deaths.
17 syls
added: It would be strange to single out my act as the cause of all those deaths.
checking: But it is a cause of them, under my analysis and also according to our common usage.
20 syls
checking: And still I deny that I have ever killed.
11 syls
checking: For a still more striking case, consider the Big Bang.
13 syls
checking: This event, I end p.184 take it, is a cause of every later event without exception.
error
checking: Then it is a cause of every death.
10 syls
checking: But the Big Bang did not kill anyone.
10 syls
checking: So killing must be a special kind of causing to die.
14 syls
checking: But what distinguishes this special kind of causation?
14 syls
checking: Not that there must be one single step of causal dependence, as opposed to an intransitive chain.
18 syls
checking: An act of killing can be a preempting cause.
12 syls
checking: It can be you who kills the victim, even though another killer was standing by who would have done the job for you—causing the victim to die the very same death—if he had not seen you lay the poison yourself.
18 syls
checking: Not that the chance of the effect must be high.
11 syls
checking: If you hook up a bomb to a randomizer and hide it in a crowded place, and it happens to go off, you can kill no matter how low you set the chance.
error
checking: Not that the causal chain must be short.
9 syls
checking: You can kill by delayed action.
8 syls
added:  Not that the causal chain must be short. You can kill by delayed action.
checking: If you set a hidden time bomb with a thousand-year fuse, you may well kill someone yet unborn.
18 syls
checking: Not that the chain must be simple.
8 syls
checking: You can kill someone by means of a lethal Rube Goldberg machine.
16 syls
checking: Not that the chain must be foreseeable.
10 syls
checking: You can kill someone no matter how good your reasons were for thinking the gun was not loaded; or no matter how unfeasible it would have been for you to discover in advance his lethal allergy to what you fed him.
18 syls
checking: Not that the chain must pass through no later human actions.
14 syls
checking: 11 If you kill by setting a baited mantrap, or by making a gift of poisoned chocolates, your unsuspecting victim's action is an intermediate step in the causal chain whereby you kill him.
error
checking: In other cases, an action by a third party may be an intermediate step: you make a gift of poisoned chocolates to the host, who offers them to the guest.
21 syls
checking: Perhaps a cluster of these conditions, inadequate if taken one by one, would work to distinguish the kind of causing that can be killing.
18 syls
checking: I think not.
3 syls
checking: But the counterexamples get too contrived to be very persuasive: imagine a lethal Rube Goldberg machine with a randomizer at one step, a thousand-year fuse at another, an alternative waiting in reserve at another, dependence on some action of the unsuspecting victim at another, and no way to discover how it works.
error
checking: end p.185 I suggest a different way to distinguish the right kind of causing: by its insensitivity to circumstances.
error
checking: When an effect depends counterfactually on a cause, in general it will depend on much else as well.
error
checking: If the cause had occurred but other circumstances had been different, the effect would not have occurred.
18 syls
checking: To the extent that this is so, the dependence is sensitive.
16 syls
checking: Likewise if a causal chain consists of several steps of causal dependence, we can say that the chain is sensitive to the extent that its steps are.
19 syls
checking: (On average?
4 syls
checking: Or at worst?
3 syls
checking: ) Sensitivity is a matter of degree, however.
15 syls
checking: It may be that the causation depends on an exceptionally large and miscellaneous bundle of circumstances all being just right.
18 syls
checking: If any little thing had been different, that cause would not have caused that effect.
18 syls
checking: But sometimes causation is comparatively insensitive to small differences in the circumstances.
18 syls
checking: When my strong recommendation causes lives and then deaths, that is comparatively sensitive causation—there are many differences that would have deflected the chain of events.
21 syls
checking: But if you shoot at your victim point-blank, only some very remarkable difference in circumstances would prevent his death.
19 syls
checking: The same is true if you set a Rube Goldberg machine, or a delayed-action  bomb, working inexorably toward its lethal outcome.
19 syls
checking: The case of the bomb with a randomizer also is comparatively insensitive: the bomb might very well have chanced not to go off, but it isn't the fine details of the circumstances that would make the difference.
error
checking: Jonathan Bennett restates my suggestion this way: killing requires "that the causal chain run through a stable and durable structure rather than depending on intervening coincidental events".
18 syls
checking: 12 A lethal Rube Goldberg machine may work in many steps, it may be full of thousand-year fuses and randomizers and alternatives waiting in reserve, its working may require the responses of unsuspecting agents, there may be no way to discover how it is built or understand how it would work; and yet it may be no less "stable and durable" for all that, and the causal chain running through it may be far more independent of "intervening coincidental events" than are most of the causal chains in the wider world.
error
checking: So it seems that the reason why a lot of causing to die is not killing is, at least partly, that the causing to die in killing must be causation of a comparatively insensitive kind.
19 syls
checking: And if this is so for killing, perhaps it is so likewise for other causatives.
18 syls
checking: Consider the ways in which you can and can't make, break, wake, or bake things.
18 syls
checking: end p.186 Insensitivity is not the same thing as any of the unsatisfactory conditions that I considered above; but of course it is connected to several of them.
error
checking: Ceteris paribus, shortness and simplicity of the chain will make for insensitivity; insensitivity, in turn, will make for foreseeability.
error
checking: The more the chain depends on a lot of circumstances being just right, the harder it is for a would-be predictor to know all he needs to know about the circumstances.
18 syls
checking: The sensitivity of the chain is an obstacle to prediction.
18 syls
checking: Unforseeability does not imply sensitivity, since any of many other obstacles to prediction might be at work.
error
checking: But unforseeability sets a minimum standard.
error
checking: If a chain is insensitive enough that you can predict it, then it is insensitive enough that you can kill by it.
18 syls
checking: Perhaps our common knowledge of what can normally be predicted sets a common standard for everyone.
18 syls
checking: Or perhaps the standard varies.
8 syls
checking: What if you are much better than I am at predicting chains that are somewhat sensitive?
19 syls
checking: I am inclined to say that if so, then indeed you can kill in ways that I cannot.
18 syls
checking: If your act and mine cause death by chains that are exactly alike, and if the duplicate chains are insensitive enough to fall within your powers of prediction but sensitive enough to frustrate mine, then you kill but I do not.
18 syls
checking: 13 My suggestion faces a problem.
error
checking: Recall that you can kill by a causal chain that has someone else's action as an intermediate step: you give someone poisoned chocolates, he unsuspectingly serves them to his guest, and thereby you kill the guest.
19 syls
checking: (It is true as well that the host unwittingly kills the guest.
15 syls
checking: But that is beside the point; the question is whether you kill the guest, and I submit that you and the host both do.
18 syls
checking: ) But if you tell the host that the chocolates are poisoned, and you order or hire or coerce or persuade him to serve them anyway, then it seems that you do not kill the guest.
18 syls
checking: You may be no less guilty, morally and in the eyes of the law, than if you had killed him; or no less praiseworthy, if the guest was Hitler.
18 syls
checking: Be that as it may, it seems that you don't kill by getting someone else to kill knowingly.
18 syls
checking: Why not, on the suggestion I have advanced?
11 syls
checking: It seems that if someone else is ready to kill knowingly when ordered or hired or coerced or persuaded to, his readiness well might be a stable and durable structure; so that by depending on this readiness, the causal chain from your action to a death well might be fairly insensitive to fortuitous circumstances.
18 syls
checking: I reply that indeed that might be so, and nevertheless we might speak as if it were not so.
18 syls
checking: That would be no surprise.
6 syls
added:  Why not, on the suggestion I have advanced? That would be no surprise.
checking: Part of our habitual end p.187 respect for other people consists in thinking that they are sensitive to a great variety of considerations, and therefore not easy to predict or control.
error
checking: It is all very well to take for granted that someone is ready to offer a guest what he takes to be harmless chocolates; to that extent, it is not disrespectful to regard his dispositions as a stable and durable structure.
18 syls
checking: Offering chocolates is no big deal.
9 syls
checking: It is another thing to take for granted that someone can be ordered or hired or coerced or persuaded to kill knowingly.
18 syls
checking: That is to take him altogether too much for granted.
14 syls
checking: The relevant disrespect lies not in thinking him willing to kill; whether that is disrespectful depends on the  circumstances and the victim.
19 syls
checking: Rather, it lies in thinking of his readiness to kill as stable and durable, inexorable, insensitive to fortuitous circumstances of the case, so that he is disposed to make weighty choices with unseemly ease.
18 syls
checking: Such disrespect might be well deserved.
9 syls
checking: We might know very well that this dull thug before us would never think twice about killing for a small fee.
18 syls
checking: Therefore, we might be sure that when you hire him, the causal chain from your action to the victim's death is as inexorable and insensitive as if it had passed instead through some strong and sturdy machine.
18 syls
checking: But we might know this, and yet be halfhearted in putting our mouths where our minds are.
18 syls
checking: Some vestige of our habitual respect might well influence how we speak.
18 syls
checking: If I am right, when you cause death by hiring this thug, you are in literal truth a killer, no less than the thug himself is.
19 syls
checking: If we deny it, I suggest that we are paying the thug a gesture of respect—insincere, undeserved, yet unsurprising.
18 syls
checking: That was an uncompromising version of my reply.
14 syls
checking: I can offer an alternative version that runs as follows.
16 syls
checking: If you hire the thug just considered, you are not in literal truth a killer.
18 syls
checking: The truth conditions for "kill" are not just a matter of insensitive causation.
18 syls
checking: They make an exception for insensitive causal chains that run through someone else's action of knowingly killing.
19 syls
checking: However, insensitivity remains the underlying idea.
19 syls
checking: The extra twist in the truth conditions is not just a brute complication of the concept; it is there, understandably, thanks to our respectful presumption that a causal chain through someone else's weighty decision will not be insensitive.
19 syls
checking: The two versions agree about what we say, and why we say it; they differ only about what is literally true.
19 syls
checking: Ceteris paribus it is bad to claim that we say what we know is literally false; but ceteris paribus it is bad to build complicating exceptions into the conditions of literal truth.
error
checking: Between the version that does one and the version that does the other, I think there is little to choose.
18 syls
checking: I am not even confident that there is a genuine issue between the two.
19 syls
checking: end p.188 D. Causation by Omission14 An omission consists of the nonoccurrence of any event of a certain sort.
error
checking: To suppose away the omission is, exactly, to suppose that some event of the given sort does occur.
18 syls
checking: We say that omissions may be caused, and may cause, and I have no wish to deny this.
18 syls
checking: I would like to be able to provide for causation by omission within the general framework given in this paper and in "Events" (in this volume).
18 syls
checking: Unfortunately, I do not see how to make it fit with all that I say in general about events and about their causal dependence.
18 syls
checking: So, one way or another, a special case it must be.
14 syls
checking: Omissions as effects are no special problem.
12 syls
checking: I must allow in any case that sometimes, by causing suitable events, causes can create a pattern of events; and that a fact can supervene on this pattern even when there is no genuine event that can be called the obtaining of that fact; in which case the causes of the events in the pattern can also be said to cause that fact to obtain.
19 syls
checking: 15 For instance, it is at least a fact that Xanthippe became a widow.
error
checking: I think there is no genuine event that can be called Xanthippe's becoming a widow.
error
checking: But the causes of her marriage together with the causes of Socrates's death may nevertheless be said to have caused her to become a widow: they caused genuine events that comprised a pattern on which the fact that she became a widow supervened.
19 syls
checking: Certainly this fact is not beyond the reach of causal explanation.
18 syls
checking: Likewise I can say that various distractions caused Fred to omit the precautions he should have taken; and in saying this, I needn't grant that there was any such thing as an event of omission.
18 syls
checking: If there are events of omission, well and good.
12 syls
checking: But I don't need them as effects.
9 syls
checking: Do I need them as causes?
7 syls
checking: There are two opposite strategies that I might follow, and a third which is a compromise between those two.
18 syls
checking: One way or another, all of them treat causation by omission as a special case.
18 syls
checking: While I would guess that any of the three could be made to work, I am not in a position to prove it by presenting fully developed versions.
18 syls
checking: I am not sure how much the three really differ; certainly some of their difference is just terminological.
18 syls
checking: end p.189 The first strategy accepts that there are events of omission.
error
checking: What is more, there are events essentially specifiable as omissions.
error
checking: For instance, Fred's omission of precautions, essentially  specifiable as such, is an event that would have occurred no matter how he omitted them, no matter what else he did instead; and that could not have occurred if he had taken the precautions.
error
checking: For any event, there are necessary and sufficient conditions, normally hard to state, for that very event to occur.
18 syls
checking: Some descriptions of an event are built into its conditions of occurrence; others are not.
20 syls
checking: The first strategy says that the description of this event as an omission is built in.
20 syls
checking: Then to suppose counterfactually that this event of omission does not occur is equivalent to supposing that Fred does take the precautions.
error
checking: So the counterfactual analysis of causation can apply to events of omission just as it does to all other events; and it is safe to say, as we ought to, that the effects which depend causally on Fred's omission are those which would not have occurred if he had taken the precautions.
error
checking: This strategy requires no exception to what I say about causation in general.
20 syls
checking: But it does require an exception to what I say about events in general.
18 syls
checking: For I say that a theory of events, if it is built to serve the needs of my analysis of causation, must reject overly disjunctive events.
18 syls
checking: An alleged event would be disjunctive if, or to the extent that, it could have occurred in various dissimilar ways.
error
checking: (The point is not that its conditions of occurrence could be formulated as a disjunction—anything can be formulated as a disjunction—but that they could be formulated as a disjunction of overly varied disjuncts.
19 syls
checking: ) An alleged event that is essentially specifiable as a talkingor-walking, and which could have occurred either as a talking or as a walking, is an example of what ought to be rejected.
error
checking: The reason is that if it were accepted as an event, then it could qualify as a cause; but it is intuitively very wrong to say that the talking-or-walking causes anything.
18 syls
checking: But if we are to accept events of omission, in the way we are considering, then we may not reject disjunctive events without exception.
18 syls
checking: For an event of omission, essentially specifiable as such, is highly disjunctive.
error
checking: Fred omits the precautions if he does something else during the period in which he was supposed to attend to them.
19 syls
checking: So there are as many different ways for the event of omission to occur as there are alternative ways for Fred to spend the time.
18 syls
checking: An event essentially specifiable as an omission amounts to an event essentially specifiable as a sleeping-or-loafing-or-chatting-or- .
error
checking: .
0 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: with a disjunct for everything Fred might do other than attending to the precautions.
error
checking: If omissions are accepted as genuine events and as causes, while other alleged disjunctive events are rejected, end p.190 that makes causation by omission a special case.
18 syls
checking: 16 The unfinished business for this strategy, of course, is to draw the line: how do we distinguish the genuine omissions from other alleged events that we should still reject?
error
checking: For instance, I think we ought not to say that the laws of nature, or other regularities, cause things; yet regularities may be made out to be omissions on a cosmic scale—the universe omits to contain events that would violate them.
19 syls
checking: We must somehow deny that we have here a genuine event of omission.
20 syls
checking: The second, opposite, strategy says that there are no events of omission.
20 syls
checking: Then there is no need to make a place for them within a theory of events, and no need to worry that they would be like other alleged events that are to be rejected.
19 syls
checking: So far, so good.
4 syls
checking: But in that case, I need to make an exception to what I say about causation itself.
18 syls
checking: For it is not to be denied that there is causation by omission; and I cannot analyze this in my usual way, in terms of counterfactual dependence between distinct events.
18 syls
checking: Instead I have to switch to a different kind of counterfactual for the special case.
error
checking: The counterfactual is not: if event c (the end p.191 omission) had not occurred.
error
checking: .
0 syls
checking: .
0 syls

0 syls
checking: It is rather: if some event of kind K (the omitted kind) had occurred.
19 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: But if we use special counterfactuals for the special case, that opens several questions.
error
checking: Again we need to draw a line.
8 syls
checking: I thought it necessary to block some counterexamples against a counterfactual analysis of causation by insisting that counterfactual dependence was to be between events.
error
checking: If we give that up, what new line shall we retreat to?
13 syls
checking: As before, alleged causation by the laws of nature, regarded as cosmic omissions, will illustrate the problem.
18 syls
checking: Also, I thought it necessary to insist on distinctness between events that stand in causal dependence, and by distinctness I meant more than nonidentity.
error
checking: (See "Events".
3 syls
checking: ) But how does distinctness apply to  causation by omission?
error
checking: Fred sleeps, thereby omitting precautions against fire and also omitting precautions against burglary.
20 syls
checking: Two distinct omissions?
6 syls
checking: The third, compromise strategy accepts events of omission as causes; but this time, the events of omission are not essentially specified as such.
19 syls
checking: Fred omits the precautions, sleeping through the time when he was supposed to attend to them.
18 syls
checking: His nap was a genuine event; it is not objectionably disjunctive.
error
checking: There are many and varied ways in which he could have omitted the precautions, but there is just one way that he did omit them.
20 syls
checking: We could plausibly say, then, that his nap was his omission of precautions.
19 syls
checking: But accidentally so.
7 syls
checking: His nap could have occurred without being an omission of precautions: if (1) that very nap had been taken somewhat later, with the precautions seen to beforehand; or conceivably (2) if he had taken the precautions somehow in his sleep, or (3) if that very nap could have been taken by someone else, or (4) if the precautions had not been his responsibility.
18 syls
checking: (I take it that (2)-(4) are problematic in various ways; so I rest my case mainly on (1).
error
checking: ) And an omission of precautions might very well have occurred without being that nap: he might have stayed awake and done any of many other things instead of attending to the precautions.
18 syls
checking: Still, as it was, the nap was what happened instead of the taking of precautions.
20 syls
checking: So we may call it an event of omission, though we do not thereby capture its essence.
18 syls
checking: We can have events of omission, so understood, and still reject disjunctive events without exception.
error
checking: But this third strategy, like the second, demands special counterfactuals for the special case.
error
checking: Even if Fred's nap was his omission of precautions, it is one thing to suppose that this very event did not occur, and it is another thing to suppose that no event that occurred (this or any other) was an omission of the precautions.
18 syls
checking: It is one thing to suppose away the event simpliciter, another thing to suppose it away qua end p.192 omission.
error
checking: It is the second counterfactual supposition, not the first, that is relevant to causation by omission.
error
checking: For it is the second supposition that is equivalent to supposing that the precautions were taken.
20 syls
checking: But this is special.
5 syls
checking: In other cases the relevant counterfactuals are those that suppose away an event simpliciter; we do not in general need to suppose away events qua satisfying some or other accidental specification.
error
checking: As with the second strategy, resort to special counterfactuals for the special case threatens to undo our defenses against various counter-examples.
error
checking: It remains to be seen how, if at all, those defenses could be rebuilt.
18 syls
checking: This strategy, like the others, leaves us with unfinished business.
16 syls
checking: E. Redundant Causation17 Suppose we have two events c 1 and c 2 , and another event e distinct from both of them; and in actuality all three occur; and if either one of c 1 and c 2 had occurred without the other, then also e would have occurred; but if neither c 1 nor c 2 had occurred, then e would not have occurred.
error
checking: Then I shall say that c 1 and c 2 are redundant causes of e. (There might be redundant causation with a set of more than two redundant causes.
error
checking: There might be probabilistic redundant causation, in which e would have had some small chance of occurring even if neither c 1 nor c 2 had occurred.
error
checking: There might be stepwise redundant causation without direct dependence, as described by Louis Loeb.
error
checking: 18 I pass over these complications and consider redundant causation in its simplest form.
error
checking: ) As in my definition of ordinary causation, the counterfactuals concern particular events, not event-kinds.
error
checking: So it is not redundant causation if you shoot a terminal cancer patient—or, for that matter, a healthy young mortal—who would sooner or later have died anyway.
19 syls
checking: Without your act end p.193 he would have died a different death: numerically different, because very different in time and manner.
error
checking: The particular event which is the death he actually dies would not have occurred.
18 syls
checking: If you shoot a man who is being stalked by seven other gunmen, that may be redundant causation— the answer depends partly on details of the underdescribed case, partly on unsettled standards of how much difference it takes to make a different event.
18 syls
checking: If you shoot a man who is simultaneously  being shot by seven other members of your firing squad, that doubtless is redundant causation.
19 syls
checking: The exact number of bullets through the heart matters little.
15 syls
checking: If one event is a redundant cause of another, then is it a cause simpliciter?
18 syls
checking: Sometimes yes, it seems; sometimes no; and sometimes it is not clear one way or the other.
18 syls
checking: When common sense delivers a firm and uncontroversial answer about a not-too-far-fetched case, theory had better agree.
19 syls
checking: If an analysis of causation does not deliver the common-sense answer, that is bad trouble.
18 syls
checking: But when common sense falls into indecision or controversy, or when it is reasonable to suspect that farfetched cases are being judged by false analogy to commonplace ones, then theory may safely say what it likes.
18 syls
checking: Such cases can be left as spoils to the victor, in D. M. Armstrong's phrase.
18 syls
checking: We can reasonably accept as true whatever answer comes from the analysis that does best on the clearer cases.
18 syls
checking: It would be still better, however, if theory itself went indecisive about the hard cases.
19 syls
checking: If an analysis says that the answer for some hard case depends on underdescribed details, or on the resolution of some sort of vagueness,19 that would explain nicely why common sense comes out indecisive.
18 syls
checking: In my paper, I distinguished one kind of case—preemption with chains of dependence—in which common sense delivers clear positive and negative answers, and my counterfactual analysis succeeds in agreeing.
18 syls
checking: I left all other cases of redundant causation as spoils to the victor, doubting that common-sense opinions about them would be firm and uncontroversial enough to afford useful tests of the analysis.
18 syls
checking: end p.194 Now I would distinguish more varieties of redundant causation.
error
checking: Sometimes my analysis, as it stands, agrees with clear common-sense answers, positive or negative.
19 syls
checking: Sometimes it reproduces common-sense indecision.
14 syls
checking: Sometimes I am still content to leave far-fetched cases as spoils to the victor.
19 syls
checking: But sometimes it seems that additions to my original analysis are needed.
19 syls
checking: I consider first a class of cases distinguished by doubt as to whether they exhibit redundant causation at all.
19 syls
checking: I have already mentioned one example: you shoot a man who is being stalked by seven other gunmen.
19 syls
checking: As it actually happens, the man dies on Tuesday morning, face down on the ground, his heart pierced by your bullet, with an entry wound in his back and an exit wound in his chest.
18 syls
checking: Without your act he would have died on Wednesday evening, slumped in a chair, his heart pierced by someone else's bullet, with an entry wound in his chest and an exit wound in his back.
18 syls
checking: Is it that without your act he would have died a different death—numerically different because somewhat different in time and manner?
20 syls
checking: 20 If so, there is no redundancy.
error
checking: The particular death he actually died depends counterfactually on your act, without which that very end p.195 event would not have occurred.
error
checking: This is straightforward causation.
8 syls
checking: Or is it rather that without your act he would have died the very same death—numerically the same, despite slight differences in time and manner?
18 syls
checking: If so, there is genuine redundancy.
11 syls
checking: In that case your act would be a redundant cause; whether it would be a cause simpliciter awaits our discussion of the varieties of genuine redundant causation.
18 syls
checking: It is hard to say which is true.
8 syls
checking: It would remain hard, I think, no matter how fully we described the details of what actually happened, and of what would have happened under our counterfactual hypothesis.
19 syls
checking: Here is another example.
8 syls
checking: Suppose three neurons are hooked up thus.
9 syls
added:  Here is another example. Suppose three neurons are hooked up thus.
checking: Suppose that a neuron fires if stimulated by the firing of one or more other neurons connected to it by a stimulatory synapse (shown by a forward arrowhead).
error
checking: But suppose— fictitiously, I believe—that a neuron fires much more vigorously if it is doubly stimulated than if it is singly stimulated.
error
checking: Neurons C 1 and C 2 fire simultaneously, thereby doubly stimulating E, which  fires vigorously.
error
checking: Is this vigorous firing of E a different event from the feeble firing that would have occurred if either one of C 1 and C 2 had fired alone?
19 syls
checking: Then we have joint causation, in which the effect depends counterfactually on each of the causes, and there is no redundancy.
error
checking: Or is it that numerically the same firing would have occurred, despite a difference in manner, with single stimulation?
18 syls
checking: Then we have redundant causation.
9 syls
checking: Again it is hard to say, and again the difficulty cannot be blamed on underdescription of the details.
18 syls
checking: Call an event fragile if, or to the extent that, it could not have occurred at a different time, or in a different manner.
19 syls
checking: A fragile event has a rich essence; it has stringent conditions of occurrence.
18 syls
checking: In both our examples we have redundant causation if the effect is not too fragile, ordinary causal dependence on joint causes otherwise.
19 syls
checking: Don't say: here we have the events—how fragile are they?
14 syls
checking: Instead it should be: here we have various candidates, some more fragile and some less—which ones do we call the events?
18 syls
checking: (For instance under my proposal in "Events," in this volume, the candidates will be smaller and larger classes of possible spatiotemporal regions, more and less end p.196 tightly unified by similarity.
20 syls
checking: ) Properly posed, the question need not have a fully determinate answer, settled once and for all.
19 syls
checking: Our standards of fragility might be both vague and shifty.
16 syls
checking: As of course they are.
5 syls
checking: You can say: the performance should have been postponed until the singer was over his laryngitis; then it would have been better.
18 syls
checking: You can just as well say, and mean nothing different: the performance should have been cancelled, and another, which would have been better, scheduled later to replace it.
18 syls
checking: There's no right answer to the question how fragile the performance is.
18 syls
checking: Not because there is something—the performance—with an indeterminate size in logical space!
18 syls
checking: But because there are various things, with various sizes, and we haven't troubled to decide which one is "the performance".
19 syls
checking: Likewise every region of the earth has exact boundaries and a determinate size.
18 syls
checking: Silicon Valley, whatever exactly that is, is no exception.
18 syls
checking: However we haven't decided exactly how big a region is called "Silicon Valley".
18 syls
checking: That's why there's no right answer to the question whether these words (written on the Stanford campus) were written in Silicon Valley.
19 syls
checking: So there may be no right answer to the question whether we have a case of joint causation without redundancy; or whether instead we have a case of redundant causation, which might or might not count as causation according to considerations to be discussed later.
18 syls
checking: The answer depends on the resolution of vague standards of fragility.
20 syls
checking: If common sense falls into indecision and controversy over such cases, that is only to be expected.
18 syls
checking: It is a common suggestion to adopt extreme standards of fragility, and thereby make away with redundant causation altogether.
20 syls
checking: Even if a man is shot dead by a firing squad, presumably it would have made some minute difference to the time and manner of his death if there had been seven bullets instead of eight.
18 syls
checking: So if you fired one of the eight bullets, that made some difference; so if his death is taken to be very fragile indeed, then it would not have occurred without your act.
18 syls
checking: Under sufficiently extreme standards of fragility, the redundancy vanishes.
20 syls
checking: Even this turns out to be a case in which the effect depends on each of several joint causes.
18 syls
checking: Likewise for other stock examples of redundancy.
14 syls
checking: (Suppose we did follow this strategy wherever we could.
15 syls
checking: Wouldn't we still have residual cases of redundancy, in which it makes absolutely no difference to the effect whether both of the redundant causes occur or only one?
error
checking: Maybe so; but probably those residual cases would be mere possibilities, far-fetched and contrary to the ways of this world.
22 syls
checking: Then we could happily leave them as spoils to the victor.
14 syls
checking: For we could plausibly suggest that common sense is misled: its habits of thought are end p.197 formed by a world where every little thing that happens spreads its little traces far and wide, and nothing that happens thereafter is quite the same as it would have been after a different past.
18 syls
checking: ) Extreme standards of fragility would not fit a lot of our explicit talk about events.
20 syls
checking: We do say—within limits!
7 syls
checking: —that an event could have been postponed and could have happened differently.
17 syls
added: —that an event could have been postponed and could have happened differently.
checking: But this is not a decisive objection.
11 syls
checking: The standards that apply within the analysis of causation might differ from those that apply in explicit talk.
18 syls
checking: What matters more is that extreme standards would not fit a lot of our negative judgements about causation itself.
18 syls
checking: Extreme fragility of effects would make for spurious causal dependence in many quite ordinary cases.
20 syls
checking: It would make more trouble than it cures.
9 syls
checking: 21 For instance, suppose there was a gentle soldier on the firing squad, and he did not shoot.
error
checking: If the minute difference made by eight bullets instead of seven is enough to make a different event, then so is the minute difference made by eight instead of nine.
18 syls
checking: So if the victim's death is so very fragile that it would not have occurred without your act, equally it is so fragile that it would not have occurred without the gentle soldier's omission.
18 syls
checking: If by reason of fragility the death depends causally on your act, then equally it depends causally on the omission.
error
checking: So the gentle soldier caused the death by not shooting, quite as much as you caused it by shooting!
18 syls
checking: This is a reductio.
error
checking: That case may puzzle us because it involves at least an appearance of redundancy, and also because it involves causation by omission.
18 syls
checking: But the problem arises for cases without these complications.
17 syls
added: But the problem arises for cases without these complications.
checking: Boddie eats a big dinner, and then the poisoned chocolates.
14 syls
checking: Poison taken on a full stomach passes more slowly into the blood, which slightly affects the time and manner of the death.
18 syls
checking: If the death is extremely fragile, then one of its causes is the eating of the dinner.
19 syls
checking: Not so.
2 syls
checking: To be sure, resolution of vagueness is influenced by context; and I can imagine a special context in which we might after all agree that the eating is a cause of the death.
18 syls
checking: Pleased that Boddie is dead but horrified that the death was lingering, the poisoner says: if only he hadn't eaten, this wouldn't have happened—and by "this" he means the death, taken as very fragile.
18 syls
checking: Maybe indeed that context makes it right to say that the eating caused the death.
18 syls
checking: But it is also right, certainly in other contexts and probably even in this one, to say what is true under more lenient end p.198 and more ordinary standards of fragility: namely, that the eating did not cause the death.
18 syls
checking: 22 So if we wanted to make away with the stock examples of redundant causation, what we would require is not a uniformly stringent standard of fragility, but rather a double standard— extremely stringent when we were trying to show that an effect really depends on its alleged redundant causes, but much more lenient when we were trying to agree with common-sense judgements that an effect is not caused by just anything that slightly affects its time and manner.
error
checking: It is not out of the question that there should be such a double standard.
18 syls
checking: But if there is, an adequate theory of causation really ought to say how it works.
18 syls
checking: (The changes of standard noted above, brought on by contextual pressures, are not the ones we want—they cut across cases with and without apparent redundancy.
error
checking: ) To say how the double standard works may not be a hopeless project, but for the present it is not so much unfinished as unbegun.
18 syls
checking: Extreme fragility of effects might get rid of all but some far-fetched cases of redundant causation, but it leads to trouble that we don't know how to control.
18 syls
checking: Moderate fragility gets rid of some cases and casts doubt on others, but plenty are left.
19 syls
checking: Our topic has not disappeared.
9 syls
checking: So I return now to genuine redundant causation, including the doubtful cases when taken under standards of fragility that make them genuine.
18 syls
checking: I divide it into preemption and (symmetrical) overdetermination.
error
checking: 23 In a case of preemption, the redundant causes are not on a par.
error
checking: It seems clear that one of them, the preempting cause, does the causing; while the other, the preempted alternative, waits in reserve.
18 syls
checking: The alternative is not a cause; though it could and would have been one, if it had not been preempted.
18 syls
checking: There is the beginning of a causal process running from the preempted alternative to the effect.
19 syls
checking: But this process does not go to completion.
11 syls
checking: One effect of the preempting cause is to cut it off.
14 syls
checking: In a case of overdetermination, on the other hand, there is no such asymmetry between the redundant causes.
error
checking: It may or may not be end p.199 clear whether either is a cause; but it is clear at least that their claims are equal.
error
checking: There is nothing to choose between them.
9 syls
checking: Both or neither must count as causes.
9 syls
checking: First, preemption.
4 syls
checking: It is clear what answer we want—the preempting cause is a cause, the preempted alternative is not—and any analysis that does not yield that answer is in bad trouble.
20 syls
checking: It is  easy for me to say why the preempted alternative is not a cause: the effect does not depend on it.
18 syls
checking: My problem is to say why the preempting cause is a cause, when the effect does not depend on it either.
19 syls
checking: (A regularity analysis of causation has the opposite problem: why is the preempted alternative not a cause, when it is part of a set of conditions jointly sufficient for the effect?
19 syls
checking: ) I subdivide preemption into early and late.
13 syls
added:  First, preemption. ) I subdivide preemption into early and late.
checking: In early preemption, the process running from the preempted alternative is cut off well before the main process running from the preempting cause has gone to completion.
20 syls
checking: Then somewhere along that main process, not too early and not too late, we can find an intermediate event to complete a causal chain in two steps from the preempting cause to the final effect.
18 syls
checking: The effect depends on the intermediate, which depends in turn on the preempting cause.
18 syls
checking: (Or, in cases with more than one preempted alternative, we might need more steps.
18 syls
checking: ) We have a causal chain of stepwise dependence between the cause and the effect, even if not dependence simpliciter; and since causation is transitive, we take the ancestral of dependence.
error
checking: Thus I say that c is a cause of e if there is a sequence c, .
17 syls
added: Thus I say that c is a cause of e if there is a sequence c, .
checking: .
0 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: , e of events, consisting of c and e and zero or more intermediates, with each event in the sequence except the first depending on the one before.
21 syls
checking: (Normally all these events would be distinct, and in temporal order; but I do not require this.
18 syls
checking: See Postscript F, below.
6 syls
checking: ) This is the variety of preemption that I discussed in the paper.
19 syls
checking: To illustrate it, let us have another system of neurons.
16 syls
checking: Besides stimulatory synapses from one neuron to another, as before, we now have an inhibitory synapse as well (shown by a backward arrowhead).
error
checking: A neuron normally fires if stimulated, but not if it is inhibited end p.200 at the same time.
error
checking: Neurons C 1 and C 2 fire; thereby starting two processes of firing which make their separate ways toward neuron E. The main process, which begins with the firing of C 1 , goes to completion.
error
checking: But the alternative process, which begins with the firing of C 2 , is cut short: because neuron I is inhibited, the neurons shown dotted never fire.
error
checking: There is also a branch process, diverging from the main process.
16 syls
checking: The junction event where it diverges is the firing of neuron J. It is this branch process that cuts off the alternative process by inhibiting neuron I. The main and alternative processes—the one actual, the other partly unactualized—merge with the firing of neuron M; and proceed thence to the final effect, the firing of neuron E. Thus the firing of C 2 is the preempted alternative.
error
checking: It is not a cause of the firing of E because there is no direct dependence, and neither is there any stepwise dependence via an intermediate.
18 syls
checking: The firing of C 1 is the preempting cause.
error
checking: The firing of D is our intermediate event.
15 syls
checking: It depends counterfactually on the firing of C 1 ; the firing of E depends on it; and thereby we have our twostep chain of dependence from the preempting cause to the effect.
error
checking: For by the time of the firing of D, the alternative process was already doomed.
18 syls
checking: The alternative process was doomed as soon as neuron J fired; though it was not yet cut off, the branch process that was going to cut it off had already diverged from the main process.
error
checking: So if the firing of D had not occurred, both processes would have failed, and the firing of E also would not have occurred.
18 syls
checking: Don't say that if D had not fired, that would mean that it had not been stimulated, and that would mean that the neurons to its left on the main process would not have fired, and so neuron I would not have been inhibited, and so the alternative process would have gone to completion and E would have fired after all.
18 syls
checking: That is backtracking; and backtracking counterfactuals, however legitimate in other contexts, are out of place in tracing causal dependence.
error
checking: (See "Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow" in this volume.
error
checking: ) Of course it is not just to deal with early  preemption that we must avoid backtracking; as is explained in the paper, the avoidance of backtracking is needed also to solve the problems of effects and of epiphenomena.
19 syls
checking: We have some choice which event goes along the main process to take as our intermediate.
19 syls
checking: The firing of J comes too early: the effect does not depend on it, since without it the alternative process would not have been cut off.
18 syls
checking: The firing of M comes too late: it lies on the unactualized alternative process as well as on the main process, and so does not depend on the preempting cause.
error
checking: But anything in between would do.
9 syls
checking: What makes the solution possible is that there exists some end p.201 intermediate event in the gap between too early and too late.
error
checking: And so it is, generally, in cases of early preemption.
17 syls
added: And so it is, generally, in cases of early preemption.
checking: Thus we distinguish the genuine cause from its preempted alternative, as we should, even though either one by itself would have sufficed to cause the effect.
19 syls
checking: 24 Late preemption is harder.
error
checking: Our solution cannot succeed unless there is a sufficient gap between too early and too late; if not-too-early is already too late, there is no place for an intermediate event to complete a chain of stepwise dependence.
18 syls
checking: There are two far-fetched ways in which this problem might arise.
14 syls
checking: The first way involves action at a temporal distance.
14 syls
checking: Suppose that in our previous example, we remove all the neurons between J (too early) and M (too late).
19 syls
checking: In their place, suppose we have some law of delayed action that directly connects the firings of J and M. Iff J fires, then M fires a certain time later (as in the original example) but that is absolutely all there is to it—there is no connection between the two neurons, and no continuous causal process between their two firings.
18 syls
checking: That is possible, I take it, though it goes against what we take to be the ways of this world.
18 syls
checking: In such a case, we have no intermediate event to complete our chain of dependence.
19 syls
checking: The second way involves infinite multiple preemption.
15 syls
checking: We have infinitely many preempted alternatives, and infinitely many cut-off alternative processes.
20 syls
checking: Suppose for simplicity that the main process and its unactualized alternatives merge only at the final effect.
error
checking: (Otherwise the problem would be the same, but with the point of merging in place of the final effect.
18 syls
processed: 4000
checking: ) Then any other event on the main process is not too late to depend on earlier events along that process.
19 syls
checking: The problem is to end p.202 find an intermediate event that is not too early to take the penultimate place in our chain of stepwise dependence—that is, to find an event on which the final effect depends.
error
checking: Such an event has to come late enough that by the time it occurs, all of the infinitely many alternative processes are doomed.
18 syls
checking: Any one of the alternative processes is eventually doomed, so there is an event that comes late enough so far as it is concerned.
18 syls
checking: Likewise for any finite set.
8 syls
checking: But since there are infinitely many alternatives, there may be no event before the final effect that comes after all the alternative processes are doomed.
18 syls
checking: Suppose one of them is doomed 128 seconds before the final effect, another only 64 seconds before, another only 32 seconds before,.
error
checking: .
0 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: Then at no time before the final effect are all of them doomed.
16 syls
checking: Then there is no intermediate event on which the final effect depends.
18 syls
checking: Our causal chains of stepwise dependence can get as close as we like to the final effect, but they never can reach it.
error
checking: Then there is no stepwise dependence between the effect and what seems to be its preempting cause.
error
checking: 25 I do not worry about either of these far-fetched cases.
error
checking: They both go against what we take to be the ways of this world; they violate the presuppositions of our habits of thought; it would be no surprise if our common-sense judgements about them therefore went astray—spoils to the victor!
19 syls
checking: Common sense does judge them to be cases of causal preemption, in which what seems to be a preempting cause is indeed a cause, despite the lack of either direct or stepwise dependence.
18 syls
checking: But an  analysis that disagrees may nevertheless be accepted.
19 syls
checking: It would be better to agree with common sense about these cases, to be sure, but that is not an urgent goal.
18 syls
checking: Unfortunately there is another variety of late preemption, quite commonplace and not at all far-fetched; and there it is an urgent goal to agree with common sense.
19 syls
checking: Again we have what seems to be a preempting cause, hence a cause simpliciter, but no dependence and no stepwise dependence.
error
checking: Here my analysis seems to be in trouble.
12 syls
checking: These are cases in which an alternative process is doomed only when the final effect itself occurs.
18 syls
checking: The alternative is cut off not by a branch process that diverges from the main process at a junction event before the effect is reached, but rather by a continuation of the main process beyond the effect.
18 syls
checking: Shooting a man stalked by seven other gunmen would be a case of this kind, if it is a case of redundant causation at all, and if the other gunmen desist only when they see him dead.
18 syls
checking: Another case would be end p.203 this system of neurons.
error
checking: Again we start with the simultaneous firings of neurons C 1 and C 2 , which redundantly cause the firing of E.  I ignored such cases when I wrote the paper, and for many years afterward.
error
checking: My reason must have been that there is a ready-made solution: fragility of the effect.
20 syls
checking: If the alternative process is only doomed by the effect itself, and if at the time of the effect it is not yet complete, then the alternative process must run more slowly.
18 syls
checking: So if it had been left to produce the effect, the effect would have been delayed.
18 syls
checking: Without the firing of neuron C 1 (the seeming main cause) the firing of neuron E would have been delayed by the time it takes for three extra neurons to fire; if you had not shot the man on Tuesday morning, he would not have died until Wednesday evening; and so on, for all such cases.
error
checking: We can devise cases in which the delay is very short, but we can never get rid of it altogether.
18 syls
checking: (Or not without resort to instantaneous or backward causation.
18 syls
checking: But then the case becomes far-fetched, not worrisome, spoils to the victor.
17 syls
added: But then the case becomes far-fetched, not worrisome, spoils to the victor.
checking: ) If the effect is taken to be fragile, then the delay would suffice to give us a numerically different event instead of the effect that actually occurred.
18 syls
checking: We would have causal dependence without redundancy, thus agreeing with common sense that your shooting the man on Tuesday, or the firing of C 1 , or whatever, is indeed a cause.
18 syls
checking: But my reason for ignoring these cases was a bad reason, because the ready-made solution is a bad solution.
18 syls
checking: Fragility of the effect is no better as a remedy for these cases of late preemption than it is as a remedy for redundant causation generally.
18 syls
checking: To deal with all the cases, including those where the delay is very short and there is not much difference in manner to go with it, we need extreme standards of fragility; uniformly extreme standards are no good because they will give us lots of spurious causal dependence; so we need a double standard; and that might be workable, for all we know, but we don't know how to make it work.
18 syls
checking: There are two problems.
5 syls
checking: One is that a double standard must be principled.
13 syls
checking: We need some definite rule to tell us when we should raise the standard: when is dependence among fragile versions relevant, end p.204 and when is it not, to causation among the original robust events?
18 syls
checking: The second problem is that a stringent standard may give the wrong answer.
18 syls
checking: Let c 1 be a preempting cause of e, and let c 2 be the preempted alternative, in a case of late preemption.
error
checking: Without c 1 , e would have been delayed; and so a more fragile version of e would not have occurred at all.
error
checking: So far, so good.
4 syls
checking: But it may also be that some side effect of c 2 substantially influences the time and manner of e; in which case, unfortunately, a version of e that is fragile enough to depend on c 1 may depend on c 2 as well.
error
checking: Indeed, it may take more fragility to give us the dependence on c 1 that yields the right answer than it does to give us the dependence on c 2 that yields the wrong answer.
18 syls
checking: Though I don't reject the  fragility approach out of hand, I don't see how to make it work.
18 syls
checking: 26 So I am inclined to prefer a different solution, though it is more of a departure from my original analysis in the paper.
error
checking: Leaving the problem of late preemption in abeyance, consider this question.
18 syls
checking: Suppose we have processes—courses of events, which may or may not be causally connected—going on in two distinct spatiotemporal regions, regions of the same or of different possible worlds.
18 syls
checking: Disregarding the surroundings of the two regions, and disregarding any irrelevant events that may be occurring in either region without being part of the process in question, what goes on in the two regions is exactly alike.
18 syls
checking: Suppose further that the laws of nature that govern the two regions are exactly the same.
18 syls
checking: Then can it be that we have a causal process in one of the regions but not the other?
18 syls
checking: It seems not.
3 syls
checking: Intuitively, whether the process going on in a region is causal depends only on the intrinsic character of the process itself, and on the relevant laws.
18 syls
checking: The surroundings, and even other events in the region, are irrelevant.
20 syls
checking: Maybe the laws of nature are relevant without being intrinsic to the region (if some sort of regularity theory of lawhood is true) but nothing else is.
18 syls
checking: Intuitions of what is intrinsic are to be mistrusted, I think.
error
checking: They too often get in the way of otherwise satisfactory philosophical theories.
21 syls
checking: Nevertheless, there is some slight presumption in favor of respecting them.
18 syls
checking: Let us see where this one leads us.
8 syls
checking: A process in a region may exhibit a pattern of counterfactual dependence that makes it causal, according to my original analysis.
error
checking: Its later parts may depend counterfactually on its earlier parts (later and earlier in time, normally, but all I require is that there be dependence with end p.205 respect to some order); and in particular, its last event may depend on its first.
error
checking: (We will provide for stepwise dependence later.
error
checking: ) Now suppose that some process in some region does not itself exhibit this pattern of dependence; but suppose that in its intrinsic character it is just like processes in other regions (of the same world, or other worlds with the same laws) situated in various surroundings.
18 syls
checking: And suppose that among these processes in other regions, the great majority—as measured by variety of the surroundings—do exhibit the proper pattern of dependence.
21 syls
checking: This means that the intrinsic character of the given process is right, and the laws are right, for the proper pattern of dependence—if only the surroundings were different, and different in any of many ways.
18 syls
checking: According to my original analysis, this process is nevertheless not causal.
21 syls
checking: Thanks to its special bad surroundings, it is a mere imitation of genuine causal processes elsewhere.
18 syls
checking: But that goes against our motivating intuition.
15 syls
checking: So we might extend the analysis.
10 syls
checking: Suppose that there exists some actually occurring process of the kind just described, and that two distinct events c and e are the first and last in that process.
18 syls
checking: Then let us say that e quasi-depends on c. We might wish to count that as one kind of causation, based derivatively on counterfactual dependence even though there is no dependence between those two events themselves.
18 syls
checking: As before, we must take an ancestral to ensure that causation will come out transitive; thereby providing not only for chains of stepwise dependence, but also for chains of stepwise quasi-dependence, or mixed chains.
18 syls
checking: To this end we could redefine a causal chain as a sequence of two or more events, with either dependence or quasi-dependence at each step.
18 syls
checking: And as always, one event is a cause of another iff there is a causal chain from one to the other.
error
checking: That would solve the problem of late preemption, both in the commonplace cases that worry me and in the far-fetched cases that do not.
19 syls
checking: For the problem is that we seem to have a causal process starting with a preempting cause, and ending with the final effect; and yet this process does not exhibit the proper pattern of counterfactual dependence, not even if we count stepwise dependence.
18 syls
checking: Segments of it do exhibit dependence, but we cannot patch these segments together to make a chain that reaches all the way to the effect.
19 syls
checking: What spoils the dependence is something extraneous: the presence alongside the main process of one or more preempted alternatives.
19 syls
checking: Without them, all would be well.
7 syls
added:  So we might extend the analysis. Without them, all would be well.
checking: Hold fixed the laws but change the surroundings, in any of many ways, and we would have the dependence that my original analysis requires for causation.
18 syls
checking: But as is, we have quasi-dependence instead of end p.206  dependence.
error
checking: So if we extend the analysis, and allow causation by quasi-dependence, that solves our problem.
19 syls
checking: We then can agree with common sense that we have genuine preemption, and genuine causation by the preempting cause.
18 syls
checking: 27 The extended analysis, which allows causation by quasi-dependence, is more complicated than my original analysis; and it is less purely a counterfactual analysis, though of course counterfactual dependence still plays a central role.
error
checking: The complication would be objectionable if it were just a hoky gimmick to deal with late preemption, but it is not just that.
error
checking: For what it is worth, we also have independent motivation in the intuition of intrinsicness.
18 syls
checking: While I would still welcome a different solution to the problem of late preemption, within my original analysis, I now think that the extended analysis may well be preferable.
18 syls
checking: This completes my discussion of preemption.
11 syls
checking: I now turn to the other variety of redundant causation: overdetermination, with nothing to break the symmetry between the redundant causes.
18 syls
checking: When I wrote end p.207 the paper, I thought that all such cases were alike; that a counterfactual analysis would inevitably deny that the redundant causes in overdetermination are causes simpliciter; and that it did not matter much what the analysis said, since all such cases were spoils to the victor for lack of firm common-sense judgements.
error
checking: All that is wrong.
4 syls
checking: An important paper by Martin Bunzl changes the picture greatly.
18 syls
checking: 28 Bunzl observes that when we examine stock examples of overdetermination in detail, we can very often find an intermediate event—call it a Bunzl event—that satisfies two conditions.
error
checking: First, the Bunzl event is jointly caused, without redundancy, by the same events that are redundant causes of the final effect.
18 syls
checking: Second, the Bunzl event seems clearly to be a cause (often a preempting cause) of the final effect.
20 syls
checking: Cases of overdetermination are not all alike, because there are different kinds of Bunzl events (at least three) and also because there are some possible cases, far-fetched perhaps, with no Bunzl events at all.
error
checking: A counterfactual analysis does not deny that the redundant causes are causes simpliciter of the final effect, provided it can agree that they are causes of a Bunzl event and that the Bunzl event in turn is a cause of the effect.
error
checking: The cases should not all be left as spoils to the victor, because once a Bunzl event is noticed, it becomes clear to common sense that we have genuine causation.
18 syls
checking: One kind of Bunzl event is a preempting cause in a case of late preemption.
18 syls
checking: This system of neurons illustrates it.
10 syls
checking: Here B is an especially lethargic neuron.
error
checking: It will not fire if singly stimulated, but it will if doubly stimulated.
18 syls
checking: As usual, the simultaneous firings of C 1 and C 2 are redundant causes of the firing of E. But also they are joint causes, without redundancy, of a Bunzl event: namely, the firing of B. And that is a preempting cause of the final effect.
error
checking: The preemption is late: the two alternative processes, end p.208 those that run from the firings of C 1 and C 2 taken separately, are cut off only because of the effect itself.
error
checking: It is the firing of E itself that inhibits neurons I 1 and I 2 .
error
checking: We must apply whatever solution we favor for late preemption generally.
18 syls
checking: If somehow we had a double standard of fragility, we might say that the firing of E is extremely fragile, and would not have occurred (though E would still have fired) without the firing of B. Or, probably better, we might say that despite a lack of direct or stepwise dependence, we have causation by quasi-dependence.
18 syls
checking: Thanks to the intrinsic character of the course of events running from the firing of B to the firing of E, we would have had counterfactual dependence if just such a course of events had occurred under the same laws but in  any of various different surroundings.
18 syls
checking: According to the extended analysis, that means that the firing of B is a cause of the firing of E. Either way, we say as we should that the firing of B causes the firing of E; and therefore, by transitivity, the firing of C 1 and C 2 are both causes of E. Not only is the firing of B a preempting cause; we can also think of the entire course of events as a case of self-preemption.
18 syls
checking: The firings of C 1 and C 2 , our redundant causes, both preempt and are preempted.
error
checking: Taken together as joint causes, they preempt themselves taken separately.
20 syls
checking: A second kind of Bunzl event is a preempting cause in a case of early preemption, as in the following system of neurons.
18 syls
checking: Again the simultaneous firings of C 1 and C 2 are redundant causes of the firing of E, and joint causes without redundancy of the firing of the lethargic neuron B. As in simpler cases of early preemption, the firing of D completes a chain of stepwise dependence: it depends on the firing of B, and in turn the firing of E depends on the firing of D. So there is a three-step causal chain of dependence from the firing of C 1 to the firing end p.209 of E; and likewise from the firing of C 2 .
error
checking: More simply, there is a two-step chain, since the firing of D also depends directly on the firing of C 1 , and likewise on the firing of C 2 .
19 syls
checking: The firing of B is a Bunzl event; so is the firing of D; and so are various other intermediate events on the chain.
18 syls
checking: Again we have self-preemption by our redundant causes: the firings of C 1 and C 2 taken jointly preempt themselves, taken separately.
19 syls
checking: This looks complicated.
6 syls
checking: But just the same sort of early self-preemption can happen in much simpler cases of overdetermination, as follows.
20 syls
checking: The third kind of Bunzl event is a fragile intermediate.
17 syls
added: The third kind of Bunzl event is a fragile intermediate.
checking: Earlier, we considered a case of fragility of the effect, involving a neuron that would fire vigorously if doubly stimulated, feebly if singly stimulated.
18 syls
checking: We considered that under moderate and reasonable standards of fragility, hence without any problematic double standard, we might say that the vigorous firing and the feeble firing would differ enough in manner to make them numerically different events.
18 syls
checking: If we place the fragile vigorous firing as an effect, what we have is not redundant causation at all.
18 syls
checking: But if we place it as an intermediate, it can be the Bunzl event in a case of overdetermination.
18 syls
checking: Here is such a case, with B as the neuron that may fire either vigorously or feebly.
error
checking: The vigorous firing of B that actually occurs depends on both of the simultaneous firings of C 1 and C 2 .
18 syls
checking: Without either one of these causes it would not have occurred.
15 syls
checking: The feeble firing of B that would have occurred with only one of them would not have been the same event.
18 syls
checking: But also the firing of E depends on the firing of B. So each of our redundant causes is connected to the final effect by a two-step causal chain of dependence.
18 syls
checking: Not by direct dependence: if only one of C 1 and C 2 had fired, so that B fired feebly, E would still have been stimulated and its firing would have been  very little different.
error
checking: This is not a case that can be treated by fragility of the effect, or not under moderate standards of fragility.
19 syls
checking: (My solution depends on assuming that if the intermediate event—the vigorous firing of B—had not occurred, then B would not have fired at all.
18 syls
checking: It isn't that the vigorous firing would have been replaced by end p.210 a feeble firing, differing only just enough not to be numerically the same.
error
checking: That may seem to go against a similarity theory of counterfactuals—wouldn't the minimal change to get rid of an event be one that replaces it with a barely different event?
error
checking: Not so; a similarity theory needn't suppose that just any sort of similarity we can think of has nonzero weight.
error
checking: It is fair to discover the appropriate standards of similarity from the counterfactuals they make true, rather than vice versa.
20 syls
checking: (See "Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow" in this volume.
error
checking: ) And we certainly do not want counterfactuals saying that if a certain event had not occurred, a barely different event would have taken its place.
error
checking: They sound false; and they would make trouble for a counterfactual analysis of causation not just here, but quite generally.
error
checking: ) The case looks simpler than the self-preemption cases above; but it is really much the same.
18 syls
checking: The process from the redundant causes jointly through the vigorous firing to the effect goes to completion.
19 syls
checking: The two alternative processes from the redundant causes taken singly through the feeble firing to the effect are cut short when the feeble firing does not occur.
18 syls
checking: The feeble firing is prevented by the double stimulation of B, and that is an event in the main process.
18 syls
checking: Still there is one important difference from previous cases.
16 syls
checking: When we have a fragile intermediate, as opposed to the sorts of Bunzl events considered above, there is room for serious indeterminacy.
18 syls
checking: Just as our vague and shifty standards of fragility may leave it unsettled whether we have a fragile effect, so they may leave it unsettled whether we have a fragile intermediate.
18 syls
checking: Then they may leave it unsettled whether we have overdetermination with or without a Bunzl event.
error
checking: If that is what decides whether the redundant causes are causes simpliciter, that question too may have no right answer.
error
checking: So I turn to the last variety of redundant causation: overdetermination without a Bunzl event, including doubtful cases when taken under standards of fragility that give no relevant fragility either in the effect or in the intermediates.
error
checking: According to my original analysis, the redundant causes in such a case are not causes simpliciter, because there is neither direct nor stepwise dependence.
19 syls
checking: But the extended analysis would disagree.
13 syls
checking: There is quasi-dependence of the effect on each of the two redundant causes, and if we allowed causation by quasi-dependence, that would make the redundant causes count as genuine causes of the effect.
19 syls
checking: Also, the original analysis will say that in cases where it is doubtful whether there is a fragile effect or intermediate, then it is likewise doubtful whether the redundant causes are causes simpliciter.
18 syls
checking: Whereas end p.211 the extended analysis would say that in such cases the redundant causes are causes, though the reason why is left doubtful.
error
checking: The first analysis would be better suited to explain indecision and controversy, the second would be better suited to explain positive judgements.
19 syls
checking: I used to think that all cases of overdetermination, as opposed to preemption, could be left as spoils to the victor; and that is what I still think about these residual cases.
error
checking: All the more so, given Bunzl's discussion of what we find when we look at realistic cases in microscopic detail, without simplifying idealizations.
18 syls
checking: For it seems that cases without Bunzl events require phenomena with perfectly sharp thresholds, whereas thresholds under the laws of this world are imperfectly sharp.
19 syls
checking: Thus I am content to say that these cases may go one way or the other.
19 syls
checking: The decision will depend on what strategy emerges as victor in the cases that really matter—namely, the commonplace cases of late preemption.
18 syls
checking: I should dispel one worry: that if we ever decline to count redundant causes as genuine causes, then we will be left with gaps in our causal histories—no cause at all, at the time when the redundant causes occur, for a redundantly caused event.
19 syls
checking: That is not a problem.
6 syls
checking: For consider the  larger event composed of the two redundant causes.
19 syls
checking: (I mean their mereological sum.
error
checking: Not their disjunction—I do not know how a genuine event could be the disjunction of two events both of which actually occur.
error
checking: It would have to occur in any region where either disjunct occurs.
error
checking: Hence it would have to occur twice over in one world, which a particular event cannot do.
19 syls
checking: See "Events" in this volume.
7 syls
checking: ) Whether or not the redundant causes themselves are genuine causes, this larger event will be there to cause the effect.
18 syls
checking: For without it—if it were completely absent, with neither of its parts still present, and not replaced by some barely different event—the effect would not occur.
18 syls
checking: For ex hypothesi the effect would not occur if both redundant causes were absent, and to suppose away both of them is just the same as to suppose away the larger event that is composed of them.
error
checking: F. Self-Causation My requirement that cause and effect be distinct applies to causal dependence, but not to causation generally.
19 syls
checking: Two events are distinct if they have nothing in common: they are not identical, neither is a proper part of the other, nor do they have any common part.
21 syls
checking: Despite the truth of the appropriate counterfactuals, no event depends causally end p.212 on itself; or on any other event from which it is not distinct.
error
checking: However, I do allow that an event may cause itself by way of a two-step chain of causal dependence: c depends on d which depends in turn on c, where d and c are distinct.
18 syls
checking: Likewise for longer closed causal loops; or for loops that lead from an event back not to itself but to another event from which it is not distinct.
18 syls
checking: Thus I have taken care not to rule out the sort of self-causation which appears in time-travel stories that I take to be possible.
18 syls
checking: (See "The Paradoxes of Time Travel" in this volume.
14 syls
checking: ) But no event can be self-caused unless it is caused by some event distinct from it.
19 syls
checking: Indeed, no event can be caused at all unless it is caused by some event distinct from it.
19 syls
checking: Likewise no event can cause anything unless it causes some event distinct from it.
18 syls
checking: Suppose we think of the entire history of the world as one big event.
18 syls
checking: It is not caused by any event distinct from it; else that distinct event both would and would not be part of the entire history.
19 syls
checking: Likewise it does not cause any event distinct from it.
14 syls
checking: So it has no causes or effects at all.
11 syls
checking: Not as a whole, anyway.
7 syls
checking: Its parts, of course, do all the causing there is in the world.
14 syls
checking: Some philosophers wish to believe only in entities that have some causal efficacy.
18 syls
checking: 29 Either they must reject such totalities as the big event which is the whole of history, or else they should correct their principle.
error
checking: They might admit those inefficacious things that could have been efficacious if, for instance, there had been more of history than there actually was.
error
checking: Or, more simply, they might admit those inefficacious things that are composed entirely of efficacious parts.
error
checking: end p.213 Twenty-Two Causal Explanation* I. Causal Histories Any particular event that we might wish to explain stands at the end of a long and complicated causal history.
error
checking: We might imagine a world where causal histories are short and simple; but in the world as we know it, the only question is whether they are infinite or merely enormous.
18 syls
checking: An explanandum event has its causes.
error
checking: These act jointly.
4 syls
checking: We have the icy road, the bald tire, the drunk driver, the blind corner, the approaching car, and more.
18 syls
checking: Together, these cause the crash.
7 syls
checking: Jointly they suffice to make the crash inevitable, or at least highly probable, or at least much more probable than it would otherwise have been.
19 syls
checking: And the crash depends on each.
7 syls
checking: Without any one it would not have happened, or at least it would have been very much less probable than it was.
18 syls
checking: But these are by no means all the causes of the crash.
13 syls
checking: For one thing, each of these causes in turn has its causes; and those too are causes of the crash.
18 syls
checking: So in turn are their causes, and so, perhaps, ad infinitum.
16 syls
checking: The crash is the culmination of countless distinct, converging causal chains.
18 syls
checking: end p.214  Roughly speaking, a causal history has the structure of a tree.
error
checking: But not quite: the chains may diverge as well as converge.
13 syls
checking: The roots in childhood of our driver's reckless disposition, for example, are part of the causal chains via his drunkenness, and also are part of other chains via his bald tire.
18 syls
checking: Further, causal chains are dense.
7 syls
checking: (Not necessarily, perhaps—time might be discrete—but in the world as we mostly believe it to be.
18 syls
checking: ) A causal chain may go back as far as it can go and still not be complete, since it may leave out intermediate links.
19 syls
checking: The blind corner and the oncoming car were not immediate causes of the crash.
18 syls
checking: They caused a swerve; that and the bald tire and icy road caused a skid; that and the driver's drunkenness caused him to apply the brake, which only made matters worse.

18 syls
checking: The causal process was in fact a continuous one.
14 syls
checking: Finally, several causes may be lumped together into one big cause.
18 syls
checking: Or one cause may be divisible into parts.
12 syls
checking: Some of these parts may themselves be causes of the explanandum event, or of parts of it.
error
checking: (Indeed, some parts of the explanandum event itself may be causes of others.
error
checking: ) The baldness of the tire consists of the baldness of the inner half plus the baldness of the outer half; the driver's drunkenness consists of many different disabilities, of which several may have contributed in different ways to the crash.
18 syls
checking: There is no one right way—though there may be more or less natural ways—of carving up a causal history.
18 syls
checking: The multiplicity of causes and the complexity of causal histories are obscured when we speak, as we sometimes do, of the cause of something.
18 syls
checking: That suggests that there is only one.
9 syls
checking: But in fact it is commonplace to speak of "the X" when we know that there are many X's, and even many X's in our domain of discourse, as witness McCawley's sentence "the dog got in a fight with another dog".
18 syls
checking: If someone says that the bald tire was the cause of the crash, another says that the driver's drunkenness was the cause, and still another says that the cause was the bad upbringing which made him so reckless, I do not think any of them disagree with me when I say that the causal history includes all three.
18 syls
checking: They disagree only about which part of the causal history is most salient for the purposes of some particular inquiry.

18 syls
checking: 1 (It is sometimes thought that only an aggregate of conditions inclusive enough to be sufficient all by itself—Mill's "whole cause"—deserves to be called "the cause".
error
checking: But even on this eccentric usage, we still have many deserving candidates for the title.
18 syls
checking: For if we have a whole cause at one time, then also we have other whole causes at later times, and perhaps at earlier times as well.
18 syls
checking: ) A causal history is a relational structure.
14 syls

checking: 3 I include relations of probabilistic causal dependence.
error
checking: Those who know of the strong scientific case for saying that our world is an indeterministic one, and that most events therein are to some extent matters of chance, never seriously renounce the commonsensical view that there is plenty of causation in the world.

18 syls
checking: But whatever that may mean, evidently it does not imply any shortage of causation.
18 syls
checking: ) For instance, they would never dream of agreeing with those ignorant tribes who disbelieve that pregnancies are caused by events of sexual intercourse.
18 syls
checking: The causation they believe in must be probabilistic.
error
checking: And if, as seems likely, our world is indeed thoroughly indeterministic and chancy, its causal histories must be largely or entirely structures of probabilistic causal dependence.
error
checking: I take such dependence to obtain when the objective chances of some events depend counterfactually upon other events: if the cause had not been, the effect would have been very much less probable than it actually was.
18 syls
checking: (See Postscript B to "Causation," in this volume.
12 syls
checking: ) But again, what is said in this paper should be compatible with any analysis of probabilistic causation.
19 syls
checking: The causal history of a particular event includes that event itself, and all events which are part of it.
19 syls
checking: Further, it is closed under causal dependence: anything on which an event in the history depends is itself an event in the history.
18 syls
checking: (A causal history need not be closed under the converse relation.

error
checking: Explanation as Information Here is my main thesis: to explain an event is to provide some information about its causal history.
18 syls
checking: In an act of explaining, someone who is in possession of some information end p.217 about the causal history of some event—explanatory information, I shall call it—tries to convey it to someone else.
21 syls
checking: Normally, to someone who is thought not to possess it already, but there are exceptions: examination answers and the like.
18 syls
checking: Afterward, if the recipient understands and believes what he is told, he too will possess the information.
18 syls
checking: The why-question concerning a particular event is a request for explanatory information, and hence a request that an act of explaining be performed.
18 syls
checking: In one sense of the word, an explanation of an event is such an act of explaining.
18 syls
checking: To quote Sylvain Bromberger, "an explanation may be something about which it makes sense to ask: How long did it take?

9 syls
checking: 4 But it is not clear whether just any act of explaining counts as an explanation.
error
checking: Some acts of explaining are unsatisfactory; for instance the explanatory information provided might be incorrect, or there might not be enough of it, or it might be stale news.
22 syls
checking: If so, do we say that the performance was no explanation at all?
18 syls
checking: Or that it was an unsatisfactory explanation?
15 syls
checking: The answer, I think, is that we will gladly say either—thereby making life hard for those who want to settle, once and for all, the necessary and sufficient conditions for something to count as an explanation.
18 syls
checking: Fortunately that is a project we needn't undertake.
error
checking: Bromberger goes on to say that an explanation "may be something about which none of [the previous] questions makes sense, but about which it makes sense to ask: Does anyone know it?
error
checking: Who thought of it first?
5 syls
checking: Is it very complicated"?
8 syls
checking: An explanation in this second sense of the word is not an act of explaining.
18 syls
checking: It is a chunk of explanatory information—information that may once, or often, or never, have been conveyed in an act of explaining.
18 syls
checking: (It might even be information that never could be conveyed, for it might have no finite expression in any language we could ever use.
18 syls
checking: )  It is a proposition about the causal history of the explanandum event.
error
checking: Again it is unclear—and again we needn't make it clear—what to say about an unsatisfactory chunk of explanatory information, say one that is incorrect or one that is too small to suit us.
error
checking: We may call it a bad explanation, or no explanation at all.
18 syls
checking: Among the true propositions about the causal history of an event, one is maximal in strength.
18 syls
checking: It is the whole truth on the subject—the biggest chunk of explanatory information that is free of error.
19 syls
checking: We end p.218 might call this the whole explanation of the explanandum event, or simply the explanation.
error
checking: (But "the explanation" might also denote that one out of many explanations, in either sense, that is most salient in a certain context.
21 syls
checking: ) It is, of course, very unlikely that so much explanatory information ever could be known, or conveyed to anyone in some tremendous act of explaining!
21 syls
checking: One who explains may provide not another, but rather himself, with explanatory information.
22 syls
checking: He may think up some hypothesis about the causal history of the explanandum event, which hypothesis he then accepts.
18 syls
checking: Thus Holmes has explained the clues (correctly or not, as the case may be) when he has solved the crime to his satisfaction, even if he keeps his solution to himself.
18 syls
checking: His achievement in this case probably could not be called "an explanation"; though the chunk of explanatory information he has provided himself might be so called, especially if it is a satisfactory one.

checking: And if so, they might comprise all or part of a cross-section of the causal history: several events, more or less simultaneous and causally independent of one another, that jointly cause the explanandum.
19 syls
checking: Alternatively, he might trace a causal chain.
12 syls
checking: He might specify a sequence of events in the history, ending with the explanandum, each of which is among the causes of the next.
18 syls
checking: Or he might trace a more complicated, branching structure that is likewise embedded in the complete history.
18 syls
checking: An explainer well might be unable to specify fully any particular event in the history, but might be in a position to make existential statements.
error
checking: He might say, for instance, that the history includes an event of such-and-such kind.
18 syls
checking: Or he might say that the history includes several events of such-and-such kinds, related to one another in such-and-such ways.
18 syls
checking: In other words, he might make an existential statement end p.219 to the effect that the history includes a pattern of events of a certain sort.
error
checking: (Such a pattern might be regarded, at least in some cases, as one complex and scattered event with smaller events as parts.
19 syls
checking: ) He might say that the causal history has a certain sort of cross-section, for instance, or that it includes a certain sort of causal chain.
19 syls
checking: In someone says that the causal history includes a pattern of events having such-and-such description, there are various sorts of description that he might give.
19 syls
checking: A detailed structural specification might be given, listing the kinds and relations of the events that comprise the pattern.
18 syls
checking: But that is not the only case.
8 syls
checking: The explainer might instead say that the pattern that occupies a certain place in the causal history is some biological, as opposed to merely chemical, process.
error
checking: Or he might say that it has some global structural feature: it is a case of underdamped negative feedback, a dialectical triad, or a resonance phenomenon.
18 syls
checking: (And he might have reason to say this even if he has no idea, for instance, what sort of thing it is that plays the role of a damper in the system in  question.
18 syls
checking: ) Or he might say that it is a process analogous to some other, familiar process.
18 syls
checking: (So in this special case, at least, there is something to the idea that we may explain by analogizing the unfamiliar to the familiar.
18 syls
checking: At this point I am indebted to David Velleman.
error
checking: ) Or he might say that the causal process, whatever it may be, is of a sort that tends in general to produce a certain kind of effect.
18 syls
checking: I say "we have lungs because they keep us alive"; my point being that lungs were produced by that process, whatever it may be, that can and does produce all manner of life-sustaining organs.
18 syls
checking: (In conveying that point by those words, of course I am relying on the shared presupposition that such a process exists.
18 syls
checking: In explaining, as in other communication, literal meaning and background work together.
18 syls
checking: ) And I might say this much, whether or not I have definite opinions about what sort of process it is that produces life-sustaining organs.
18 syls
checking: My statement is neutral between evolution, creation, vital forces, or what have you; it is also neutral between opinionation and agnosticism.
19 syls
checking: In short: information about what the causal history includes may range from the very specific to the very abstract.
18 syls
checking: But we are still not done.
6 syls
checking: There is also negative information: information about what the causal history does not include.
18 syls
checking: "Why was the CIA man there when His Excellency dropped dead?
15 syls
checking: —Just coincidence, believe it or not".
10 syls
checking: Here the information given is negative, to the effect that a certain sort of pattern of events—namely, a plot—does not figure in the causal history.
18 syls
checking: (At least, not in that fairly recent part where one might have been suspected.
18 syls
checking: Various ancient plots doubtless figure in the causal histories of all current events, this one included.
18 syls
checking: ) end p.220 A final example.
error
checking: The patient takes opium and straightway falls asleep; the doctor explains that opium has a dormitive virtue.
error
checking: Doubtless the doctor's statement was not as informative as we might have wished, but observe that it is not altogether devoid of explanatory information.
18 syls
checking: The test is that it suffices to rule out at least some hypotheses about the causal history of the explanandum.
18 syls
checking: It rules out this one: the opium merchants know that opium is an inert substance, yet they wish to market it as a soporific.
18 syls
checking: So they keep close watch; and whenever they see a patient take opium, they sneak in and administer a genuine soporific.
18 syls
checking: The doctor has implied that this hypothesis, at least, is false; whatever the truth may be, at least it somehow involves distinctive intrinsic properties of the opium.
19 syls
checking: Of course I do not say that all explanatory information is of equal worth; or that all of it equally deserves the honorific name "explanation".
18 syls
checking: My point is simply that we should be aware of the variety of explanatory information.
18 syls
checking: We should not suppose that the only possible way to give some information about how an event was caused is to name one or more of its causes.
20 syls
checking: III.
error
checking: Non-Causal Explanation?
7 syls
added:  —Just coincidence, believe it or not". Non-Causal Explanation?
checking: It seems quite safe to say that the provision of information about causal histories figures very prominently in the explaining of particular events.
18 syls
checking: What is not so clear is that it is the whole story.
13 syls
checking: Besides the causal explanation that I am discussing, is there also any such thing as non-causal explanation of particular events?
19 syls
checking: My main thesis says there is not.
8 syls
checking: I shall consider three apparent cases of it, one discussed by Hempel and two suggested to me by Peter Railton.
19 syls
checking: 5 First case.
error
checking: We have a block of glass of varying refractive index.
15 syls
checking: A beam of light enters at point A and leaves at point B. In between, it passes through point C. Why?
18 syls
checking: Because C falls on the path from A to B that takes light the least time to traverse; and according to Fermat's principle of end p.221 least time, that is the path that any light going from A to B must follow.
18 syls
checking: That seems noncausal.
error
checking: The light does not get to C because it looks ahead, calculates the path of least time to its destination B, and steers accordingly!
18 syls
checking: The refractive index in parts of the glass that the light has not yet reached has nothing to do with causing it to get to C, but that is part of what makes it so that C is on the path of least time from A to B. I reply that it is by no means clear that the light's passing through C has been explained.
18 syls
checking: But if it has, that is because this explanation combines with information that its recipient already possesses to imply something about the causal history of the explanandum.
20 syls
checking: Any likely recipient of  an explanation that mentions Fermat's principle must already know a good deal about the propagation of light.
error
checking: He probably knows that the bending of the beam at any point depends causally on the local variation of refractive index around that point.
18 syls
checking: He probably knows, or at least can guess, that Fermat's principle is somehow provable from some law describing that dependence together with some law relating refractive index to speed of light.
error
checking: Then he knows this: (1) the pattern of variation of the refractive index along some path from A to C is part of the causal history of the light's passing through C, and (2) the pattern is such that it, together with a pattern of variation elsewhere that is not part of the causal history, makes the path from A to C be part of a path of least time from A to B. To know this much is not to know just what the pattern that enters into the causal history looks like, but it is to know something—something relational—about that pattern.
error
checking: So the explanation does indeed provide a peculiar kind of information about the causal history of the explanandum, on condition that the recipient is able to supply the extra premises needed.
21 syls
checking: Second case.
3 syls
checking: A star has been collapsing, but the collapse stops.
12 syls
checking: Why?
1 syls
checking: Because it's gone as far as it can go.
11 syls
checking: Any more collapsed state would violate the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
19 syls
checking: It's not that anything caused it to stop—there was no countervailing pressure, or anything like that.
18 syls
checking: There was nothing to keep it out of a more collapsed state.
14 syls
checking: Rather, there just was no such state for it to get into.
14 syls
checking: The state-space of physical possibilities gave out.
14 syls
checking: (If ordinary space had boundaries, a similar example could be given in which ordinary space gives out and something stops at the edge.
18 syls
checking: ) I reply that information about the causal history of the stopping has indeed been provided, but it was information of an unexpectedly negative sort.
18 syls
checking: It was the information that the stopping had no causes at all, except for all the causes of the collapse which was a precondition of the stopping.
19 syls
checking: Negative information is still information.
13 syls
checking: If you request end p.222 information about arctic penguins, the best information I can give you is that there aren't any.
error
checking: Third case.
2 syls
checking: Walt is immune to smallpox.
7 syls
checking: Why?
1 syls
checking: Because he possesses antibodies capable of killing off any smallpox virus that might come along.
19 syls
checking: But his possession of antibodies doesn't cause his immunity.
error
checking: It is his immunity.
7 syls
added:  Third case. Walt is immune to smallpox. Why? It is his immunity.
checking: Immunity is a disposition, to have a disposition is to have something or other that occupies a certain causal role, and in Walt's case what occupies the role is his possession of antibodies.
18 syls
checking: I reply that it's as if we'd said it this way: Walt has some property that protects him from smallpox.
20 syls
checking: Why?
1 syls
checking: Because he possesses antibodies, and possession of antibodies is a property that protects him from smallpox.
19 syls
checking: Schematically: Why is it that something is F?
error
checking: Because A is F. An existential quantification is explained by providing an instance.
18 syls
checking: I agree that something has been explained, and not by providing information about its causal history.
20 syls
checking: But I don't agree that any particular event has been non-causally explained.
18 syls
checking: The case is outside the scope of my thesis.
11 syls
checking: That which protects Walt—namely, his possession of antibodies—is indeed a particular event.
19 syls
checking: It is an element of causal histories; it causes and is caused.
18 syls
checking: But that was not the explanandum.
error
checking: We could no more explain that just by saying that Walt possesses antibodies than we could explain an event just by saying that it took place.
20 syls
checking: What we did explain was something else: the fact that something or other protects Walt.
19 syls
checking: The obtaining of this existential fact is not an event.
16 syls
checking: It cannot be caused.
5 syls
checking: Rather, events that would provide it with a truth-making instance can be caused.
18 syls
checking: We explain the existential fact by identifying the truth-making instance, by providing information about the causal history thereof, or both.
19 syls
checking: (For further discussion of explanation of facts involving the existence of patterns of events, see Section VIII of "Events," in this volume.
20 syls
checking: ) What more we say about the case depends on our theory of dispositions.
20 syls
checking: 6 I take for granted that a disposition requires a causal basis: one has the disposition iff one has a property that occupies a certain end p.223 causal role.
error
checking: (I would be inclined to require that this be an intrinsic property, but that is controversial.
19 syls
checking: ) Shall we then identify the disposition with its basis?
16 syls
checking: That would make the  disposition a cause of its manifestations, since the basis is.
18 syls
checking: But the identification might vary from case to case.
15 syls
checking: (It surely would, if we count the unactualized cases.
error
checking: ) For there might be different bases in different cases.
15 syls
checking: Walt might be disposed to remain healthy if exposed to virus on the basis of his possession of antibodies, but Milt might be so disposed on the basis of his possession of dormant antibody-makers.
18 syls
checking: Then if the disposition is the basis, immunity is different properties in the cases of Walt and Milt.
19 syls
checking: Or better: "immunity" denotes different properties in the two cases, and there is no property of immunity simpliciter that Walt and Milt share.
18 syls
checking: That is disagreeably odd.
error
checking: But Walt and Milt do at least share something: the existential property of having some basis or other.
18 syls
checking: This is the property such that, necessarily, it belongs to an individual X iff X has some property that occupies the appropriate role in X's case.
18 syls
checking: So perhaps we should distinguish the disposition from its various bases, and identify it rather with the existential property.
18 syls
checking: That way, "immunity" could indeed name a property shared by Walt and Milt.
18 syls
checking: But this alternative has a disagreeable oddity of its own.
18 syls
checking: The existential property, unlike the various bases, is too disjunctive and too extrinsic to occupy any causal role.
18 syls
checking: There is no event that is essentially a having of the existential property; a fortiori, no such event ever causes anything.
20 syls
checking: (Compare the absurd double-counting of causes that would ensue if we said, for instance, that when a match struck in the evening lights, one of the causes of the lighting is an event that essentially involves the property of being struck in the evening or twirled in the morning.
18 syls
checking: I say there is no such event.
8 syls
checking: ) So if the disposition is the existential property, then it is causally impotent.
18 syls
checking: On this theory, we are mistaken whenever we ascribe effects to dispositions.
18 syls
checking: Fortunately we needn't decide between the two theories.
error
checking: Though they differ on the analysis of disposition-names like "immunity," they agree about what entities there are.
21 syls
checking: There is one genuine event—Walt's possession of antibodies.
18 syls
checking: There is a truth about Walt to the effect that he has the existential property.
19 syls
checking: But there is no second event that is essentially a having of the existential property, but is not essentially a having of it in any particular way.
18 syls
checking: Whatever "Walt's immunity" may denote, it does not denote such an event.
18 syls
checking: And since there is no such event at all, there is no such event to be non-causally explained.
18 syls
checking: end p.224 IV.
error
checking: General Explanation My main thesis concerns the explanation of particular events.
18 syls
checking: As it stands, it says nothing about what it is to explain general kinds of events.
18 syls
checking: However, it has a natural extension.
12 syls
checking: All the events of a given kind have their causal histories, and these histories may to some extent be alike.
18 syls
checking: Especially, the final parts of the histories may be much the same from one case to the next, however much the earlier parts may differ.
18 syls
checking: Then information may be provided about what is common to all the parallel causal histories—call it general explanatory information about events of the given kind.
18 syls
checking: To explain a kind of event is to provide some general explanatory information about events of that kind.
21 syls
checking: Thus explaining why struck matches light in general is not so very different from explaining why some particular struck match lit.
18 syls
checking: In general, and in the particular case, the causal history involves friction, small hot spots, liberation of oxygen from a compound that decomposes when hot, local combustion of a heated inflammable substance facilitated by this extra oxygen, further heat produced by this combustion, and so on.
18 syls
checking: There are intermediate degrees of generality.
15 syls
checking: If we are not prepared to say that every event of such-and-such kind, without exception, has a causal history with so-and-so features, we need not therefore abjure generality altogether and stick to explaining events one at a time.
18 syls
checking: We may generalize modestly, without laying claim to universality, and say just that quite often an event of such-and-such kind has a causal history with so-and-so features.
21 syls
checking: Or we may get a bit more ambitious and say that it is so in most cases, or at least in most cases that are likely to arise under the circumstances that prevail hereabouts.
18 syls
checking: Such modest generality may be especially characteristic of history and the social sciences; but it appears also in the physical sciences of complex systems,  such as meteorology and geology.
18 syls
checking: We may be short of known laws to the effect that storms with feature X always do Y, or always have a certain definite probability of doing Y. Presumably there are such laws, but they are too complicated to discover either directly or by derivation from first principles.
19 syls
checking: But we do have a great deal of general knowledge of the sorts of causal processes that commonly go on in storms.
19 syls
checking: The pursuit of general explanations may be very much more widespread in science than the pursuit of general laws.
19 syls
checking: And not necessarily because we doubt that there are general laws to pursue.
18 syls
checking: Even if the scientific community unanimously believed in the existence of powerful end p.225 general laws that govern all the causal processes of nature, and whether or not those laws were yet known, meteorologists and geologists and physiologists and historians and engineers and laymen would still want general knowledge about the sorts of causal processes that go on in the systems they study.
19 syls
checking: V. Explaining Well and Badly An act of explaining may be more or less satisfactory, in several different ways.
18 syls
checking: It will be instructive to list them.
9 syls
checking: It will not be instructive to fuss about whether an unsatisfactory act of explaining, or an unsatisfactory chunk of explanatory information, deserves to be so-called, and I shall leave all such questions unsettled.
20 syls
checking: 1.
error
checking: An act of explaining may be unsatisfactory because the explanatory information provided is unsatisfactory.
22 syls
checking: In particular, it might be misinformation: it might be a false proposition about the causal history of the explanandum.
18 syls
checking: This defect admits of degree.
8 syls
checking: False is false, but a false proposition may or may not be close to the truth.
18 syls
checking: 7 If it has a natural division into conjuncts, more or fewer of them may be true.
error
checking: If it has some especially salient consequences, more or fewer of those may be true.
18 syls
checking: The world as it is may be more or less similar to the world as it would be if the falsehood were true.
18 syls
checking: 2.
error
checking: The explanatory information provided may be correct, but there may not be very much of it.
18 syls
checking: It might be a true but weak proposition; one that excludes few (with respect to some suitable measure) of the alternative possible ways the causal history of the explanandum might be.
19 syls
checking: Or the information provided might be both true and strong, but unduly disjunctive.
19 syls
checking: The alternative possibilities left open might be too widely scattered, too different from one another.
18 syls
checking: These defects too end p.226 admit of degree.
error
checking: Other things being equal, it is better if more correct explanatory information is provided, and it is better if that information is less disjunctive, up to the unattainable limit in which the whole explanation is provided and there is nothing true and relevant left to add.
20 syls
checking: 3.
error
checking: The explanatory information provided may be correct, but not thanks to the explainer.
18 syls
checking: He may have said what he did not know and had no very good reason to believe.
18 syls
checking: If so, the act of explaining is not fully satisfactory, even if the information provided happens to be satisfactory.
18 syls
checking: 4.
error
checking: The information provided, even if satisfactory in itself, may be stale news.
18 syls
processed: 4500
checking: It may add little or nothing to the information the recipient possesses already.
19 syls
checking: 5.
error
checking: The information provided may not be of the sort the recipient most wants.
19 syls
checking: He may be especially interested in certain parts of the causal history, or in certain questions about its overall structure.
20 syls
checking: If so, no amount of explanatory information that addresses itself to the wrong questions will satisfy his wants, even if it is correct and strong and not already in his possession.
19 syls
checking: 6.
error
checking: Explanatory information may be provided in such a way that the recipient has difficulty in assimilating it, or in disentangling the sort of information he wants from all the rest.
18 syls
checking: He may be given more than he can handle, or he may be given it in a disorganized  admit of degree.
18 syls
checking: Other things being equal, it is better if more correct explanatory information is provided, and it is better if that information is less disjunctive, up to the unattainable limit in which the whole explanation is provided and there is nothing true and relevant left to add.
20 syls
checking: jumble.
2 syls
checking: 8 Or he may be given it in so unconvincing a way that he doesn't believe what he's told.
error
checking: If he is hard to convince, just telling him may not be an effective way to provide him with information.
18 syls
checking: You may have to argue for what you tell him, so that he will have reason to believe you.
18 syls
checking: 7.
error
checking: The recipient may start out with some explanatory misinformation, and the explainer may fail to set him right.
20 syls
checking: This list covers much that philosophers have said about the merits and demerits of explanations, or about what does and what doesn't deserve the name.
18 syls
checking: And yet I have not been talking specifically about explanation at all!
18 syls
checking: What I have been saying applies just as well to acts of providing information about any large and complicated structure.
21 syls
checking: It might as well have been the rail and tram network of Melbourne rather than the causal history of some explanandum event.
18 syls
checking: The information provided, and the act of providing it, can be satisfactory or not in precisely end p.227 the same ways.
18 syls
checking: There is no special subject: pragmatics of explanation.
error
checking: Philosophers have proposed further desiderata.
14 syls
checking: A good explanation ought to show that the explanandum event had to happen, given the laws and the circumstances; or at least that it was highly probable, and could therefore have been expected if we had known enough ahead of time; or at least that it was less surprising than it may have seemed.
error
checking: A good explanation ought to show that the causal processes at work are of familiar kinds; or that they are analogous to familiar processes; or that they are governed by simple and powerful laws; or that they are not too miscellaneous.
18 syls
checking: But I say that a good explanation ought to show none of these things unless they are true.
19 syls
checking: If one of these things is false in a given case, and if the recipient is interested in the question of whether it is true, or mistakenly thinks that it is true, then a good explanation ought to show that it is false.
19 syls
checking: But that is nothing special: it falls under points 1, 5, and 7 of my list.
error
checking: It is as if someone thought that a good explanation of any current event had to be one that revealed the sinister doings of the CIA.
19 syls
checking: When the CIA really does play a part in the causal history, we would do well to tell him about it: we thereby provide correct explanatory information about the part of the causal history that interests him most.
18 syls
checking: But in case the CIA had nothing to do with it, we ought not to tell him that it did.
18 syls
checking: Rather we ought to tell him that it didn't.
error
checking: Telling him what he hopes to hear is not even a merit to be balanced off against the demerit of falsehood.
19 syls
checking: In itself it has no merit at all.
10 syls
checking: What does have merit is addressing the right question.
13 syls
checking: This much is true.
4 syls
checking: We are, and we ought to be, biased in favor of believing hypotheses according to which what happens is probable, is governed by simple laws, and so forth.
20 syls
checking: That is relevant to the credibility of explanatory information.
18 syls
checking: But credibility is not a separate merit alongside truth; rather, it is what we go for in seeking truth as best we can.
18 syls
checking: Another proposed desideratum is that a good explanation ought to produce understanding.
error
checking: If understanding involves seeing the causal history of the explanandum as simple, familiar, or whatnot, I have already registered my objection.
error
checking: But understanding why an event took place might, I think, just mean possession of explanatory information about it—the more of that you possess, the better you understand.
19 syls
checking: If so, of course a good explanation produces understanding.
17 syls
added: If so, of course a good explanation produces understanding.
checking: It produces possession of that which it provides.
13 syls
checking: But this desideratum, so construed, is empty.
error
checking: It adds nothing to our understanding of explanation.
16 syls
checking: end p.228 VI.
error
checking: Why-Questions, Plain and Contrastive A why-question, I said, is a request for explanatory information.
error
checking: All questions are requests for information of some or other sort.
17 syls
added: All questions are requests for information of some or other sort.
checking: 9 But there is a distinction to be made.
error
checking: Every question has a maximal true answer: the whole truth about the subject matter on which information is requested, to  which nothing could be added without irrelevancy or error.
18 syls
checking: In some cases it is feasible to provide these maximal answers.
18 syls
checking: Then we can reasonably hope for them, request them, and settle for nothing less.
19 syls
checking: "Who done it?
3 syls
checking: —Professor Plum".
4 syls
checking: There's no more to say.
6 syls
checking: In other cases it isn't feasible to provide maximal true answers.
error
checking: There's just too much true information of the requested sort to know or to tell.
18 syls
checking: Then we do not hope for maximal answers and do not request them, and we always settle for less.
18 syls
checking: The feasible answers do not divide sharply into complete and partial.
19 syls
checking: They're all partial, but some are more partial than others.
14 syls
checking: There's only a fuzzy line between enough and not enough of the requested information.
18 syls
checking: "What's going on here"?
6 syls
checking: —No need to mention that you're digesting your dinner.
14 syls
checking: "Who is Bob Hawke"?
4 syls
checking: —No need to write the definitive biography.
13 syls
added:  "Who is Bob Hawke"? —No need to write the definitive biography.
checking: Less will be a perfectly good answer.
10 syls
checking: Why-questions, of course, are among the questions that inevitably get partial answers.
18 syls
checking: When partial answers are the order of the day, questioners have their ways of indicating how much information they want, or what sort.
18 syls
checking: "In a word, what food do penguins eat"?
9 syls
checking: "Why, in economic terms, is there no significant American socialist party"?
18 syls

18 syls
checking: Why did I visit Melbourne in 1979, rather than Oxford or Uppsala or Wellington?
error
checking: Because Monash University invited me.

checking: I had my reasons for wanting to get there, but I won't mention those because they would have been part of the causal history no matter how I'd travelled.
18 syls
checking: Instead I'll say that I had too little time to go by train.
error
checking: If I had gone by train, my having too little time could not have been part of the causal history of my so doing.
18 syls
checking: If we distinguish plain from contrastive why-questions, we can escape a dilemma about explanation under indeterminism.
error
checking: On the one hand, we seem quite prepared to offer explanations of chance events.
18 syls
checking: Those of us who think that chance is all-pervasive (as well as those who suspend judgment) are no less willing than the staunchest determinist to explain the events that chance to happen.
19 syls
checking: 10 On the other hand, we balk at the very idea of explaining why a chance event took place—for is it not the very essence of chance that one thing happens rather than another for no reason whatsoever?
error
checking: Are we of two minds?
5 syls
added:  Why did I fly to Brisbane when last I went there? Are we of two minds?
checking: No; I think we are right to explain chance events, yet we are right also to deny that we can ever explain why a chance process yields one outcome rather than another.
18 syls
checking: According to what I've already said, indeed we cannot explain why one happened rather than the other.
18 syls
checking: (That is so regardless of the respective probabilities of the two.
18 syls
checking: ) The actual causal history of the actual chance outcome does not differ at all end p.230 also true that any causal history can be characterized completely by means of the information that can be built into D-N arguments?
18 syls
checking: That would be so if every cause of an event belongs to some set of causes that are jointly sufficient for it, given the laws; or, in the probabilistic case, that are jointly sufficient under the laws for some definite chance of it.
18 syls
checking: Is it so that causes fall into jointly sufficient sets of one or the other sort?
18 syls
checking: That does not follow, so far as I can tell, from the  counter-factual analysis of causation that I favor.
18 syls
checking: It may nevertheless be true, at least in a world governed by a sufficiently powerful system of (strict or probabilistic) laws; and this may be such a world.
21 syls
checking: If it is true, then the whole of a causal history could in principle be mapped by means of D-N arguments (with addenda in the probabilistic case) of the explanatory sort.
19 syls
checking: In short, if explanatory information is information about causal histories, as I say it is, then one way to provide it is by means of D-N arguments.
19 syls
checking: Moreover, under the hypothesis just advanced, there is no explanatory information that could not in principle be provided in that way.
21 syls
checking: To that extent the covering-law model is dead right.
14 syls
checking: But even when we acknowledge the need to distinguish explanatory D-N arguments from others, perhaps by means of explicitly causal constraints, there is something else wrong.
19 syls
checking: It is this.
3 syls
added:  To that extent the covering-law model is dead right. It is this.
checking: The D-N argument—correct, explanatory, and fully explicit—is represented as the ideal serving of explanatory information.

18 syls
checking: Just in virtue of their form, they fail to meet the standard of how much information is enough.
21 syls
checking: Hempel writes "To the extent that a statement of individual causation leaves the relevant antecedent conditions, and thus also the requisite explanatory laws, indefinite it is like a note saying that there is a treasure hidden somewhere".
20 syls

18 syls
checking: There is always more to know.
7 syls
checking: A D-N argument presents only one small part—a cross section, so to speak—of the causal history.
18 syls

14 syls

added: We might want to know about causes earlier than those presented.

19 syls
checking: (The premises of a D-N argument might tell us that the explanandum would come about through one or the other of two very different causal chains, but not tell us which one.
error
checking: ) A D-N argument might give us far from enough explanatory information, considering what sort of information we end p.237  want and what we possess already.
18 syls
checking: On the other hand, it might give us too much.
11 syls
checking: Or it might be the wrong shape, and give us not enough and too much at the same time; for it might give us explanatory information of a sort we do not especially want.
18 syls
checking: The cross-section it presents might tell us a lot about the side of the causal history we're content to take for granted, and nothing but stale news about the side we urgently want to know more about.
18 syls
checking: Is a (correct, etc.

20 syls

13 syls
checking: Other shapes and sizes of partial servings may be very much better—and perhaps also better within our reach.
18 syls
checking: It is not that I have some different idea about what is the unit of explanation.
18 syls
checking: We should not demand a unit, and that demand has distorted the subject badly.
19 syls
checking: It's not that explanations are things we may or may not have one of; rather, explanation is something we may have more or less of.
18 syls
checking: One bad effect of an unsuitable standard of enoughness is that it may foster disrespect for the explanatory knowledge of our forefathers.
error
checking: Suppose, as may be true, that seldom or never did they get the laws quite right.
18 syls
checking: Then seldom or never did they possess complete and correct D-N arguments.
20 syls
checking: Did they therefore lack explanatory knowledge?
12 syls
checking: Did they have only some notes, and not yet any of the treasure?
16 syls
checking: Surely not!
3 syls
checking: And the reason, say I, is that whatever they may not have known about the laws, they knew a lot about how things were caused.
18 syls
checking: But once again, the covering-law model needn't have the drawback of which I have been complaining; and once again it is Railton who has proposed the remedy.
error
checking: 17 His picture is similar to mine.
error
checking: Associated with each explanandum we have a vast and complicated structure; explanatory information is information about this structure; an act of explaining is an act of conveying some of this information; more or less information may be conveyed, and in general the act of explaining may be more or less satisfactory in whatever ways any act of conveying information about a large and complicated structure may be more or end p.238 less satisfactory.
error
checking: The only difference is that whereas for me the vast structure consists of events connected by causal dependence, for Railton it is an enormous "ideal text" consisting of D-N arguments—correct, satisfying whatever constraints need be imposed to make them explanatory, and with addenda as needed—strung together.
18 syls
checking: They fit together like proofs in a mathematics text, with the conclusion of one feeding in as a premise to another, and in the end we reach arguments to the occurrence, or at least a chance, of the explanandum itself.
19 syls
checking: It is unobjectionable to let the subject matter come in units of one argument each, so long as the activity of giving information about it needn't be broken artificially into corresponding units.
error
checking: By now, little is left in dispute.
9 syls
checking: Both sides agree that explaining is a matter of giving information, and no standard unit need be completed.
19 syls
checking: The covering-law theorist has abandoned any commitment he may once have had to a D-N analysis of causation; he agrees that not just any correct D-N argument is explanatory; he goes some distance toward agreeing that the explanatory ones give information about how the explanandum is caused; and he does not claim that we normally, or even ideally, explain by producing arguments.
18 syls
checking: For my part, I agree that one way to explain would be to produce explanatory D-N arguments; and further, that an explainer may have to argue for what he says in order to be believed.
22 syls
checking: Explanation as argument versus explanation as information is a spurious contrast.
19 syls
checking: More important, I would never deny the relevance of laws to causation, and therefore to explanation; for when we ask what would have happened in the absence of a supposed cause, a first thing to say is that the world would then have evolved lawfully.
20 syls
checking: The covering-law theorist is committed, as I am not, to the thesis that all explanatory information can be incorporated into D-N arguments; however, I do not deny it, at least not for a world like ours with a powerful system of laws.
18 syls
checking: I am committed, as he is not, to the thesis that all explaining of particular events gives some or other sort of information about how they are caused; but when we see how  many varieties of causal information there are, and how indirect they can get, perhaps this disagreement too will seem much diminished.
18 syls
checking: One disagreement remains, central but elusive.
13 syls
checking: It can be agreed that information about the prevailing laws is at least highly relevant to causal information, and vice versa; so that the pursuit of explanation and the investigation of laws are inseparable in practice.
18 syls
checking: But still we can ask whether information about the covering laws is itself part of explanatory information.
18 syls
checking: The covering law theorist says yes; I say no.
13 syls
checking: But this looks like a question that would be impossible to settle, given end p.239 that there is no practical prospect of seeking or gaining information about causes without information about laws, or information about laws without information about causes.
19 syls
checking: We can ask whether the work of explaining would be done if we knew all the causes and none of the laws.
18 syls
checking: We can ask; but there is little point trying to answer, since intuitive judgments about such preposterous situations needn't command respect.
19 syls
checking: end p.240 * Twenty-Three Events I. Introduction Events are not much of a topic in their own right.
error
checking: They earn their keep in the discussion of other topics: sometimes the semantics of nominalisations and adverbial modification, sometimes the analysis of causation and causal explanation.
20 syls
checking: There is no guarantee that events made for semantics are the same as the events that are causes and effects.
18 syls
checking: It seems unlikely, in some cases at least.
11 syls
checking: A certain mathematical sequence converges.
error
checking: There is some entity or other that we may call the converging of the sequence.
18 syls
checking: The sequence converges rapidly iff, in some sense, this entity is rapid.
error
checking: I have no objection to that; but I insist that the converging of the sequence, whatever it may be, is nothing like any event that causes or is caused.
18 syls
checking: (The so-called "events" of probability theory are something else again—propositions, or properties of things at times.

18 syls
checking: Events made in the image of nominalisations are right for some purposes, but not for mine.
error
checking: When I introduce nominalisations to denote events, as I shall, it will not be analysis of natural language but mere stipulative definition.
error
checking: end p.241 In the two previous papers, I put forward several theses about causation and explanation.
error
checking: (1) Causal dependence is counterfactual dependence between distinct events.
error

error
checking: (We must take care to use the right kind of counterfactuals: no backtrackers.
error
checking: See "Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow," in this volume.

12 syls
checking: ) (3) Any event has a causal history: a vast branching structure consisting of that event and all the events which cause it, together with all the relations of causal dependence among these events.
error
checking: (4) To explain why an event occurs is to give information about its causal history.
error
checking: Such information is inevitably partial.
13 syls
checking: An explanation may specify part of the causal history of the explanandum event, or it may just provide structural information of one or another sort about the causal history.
18 syls
checking: Goodness of explanation is governed by the pragmatic standards that apply to information-giving generally.
18 syls
checking: Since these four theses concern causation among events, their meaning cannot be entirely clear until I provide a theory of events to go with them.
19 syls
checking: Not just any theory will do.
8 syls
checking: If a theory posits too many distinct events, then many instances of counterfactual dependence between its allegedly distinct alleged events will clearly not be causal.
19 syls
checking: 1 This difficulty will arise, for instance, on a theory that posits an abundance of distinct events to match the abundance of nonequivalent  predicates in nominalisations.
error
checking: A theory that allows unlimited Boolean combination of events also will generate alleged events that enter into relations of counterfactual dependence, but that do not seem intuitively suited to cause or to be caused.
18 syls
checking: On the other hand, a sparse theory may posit too few events, forcing us to go beyond the events it countenances in order to complete our causal histories.
18 syls
checking: This difficulty will arise, for instance, on a theory that limits itself to events falling under eventnouns of ordinary language: flashes, bangs, thumps, bumps, lectures, kisses, battles.

checking: end p.242 A theory that gives events unduly rich and fragile essences also will make trouble, as we shall see.
error
checking: In this paper I shall consider what sort of theory of events I need to go with my theses about causation.
18 syls
checking: If none could be found, that would be reason to reject what I say about causation.
18 syls
checking: But I think a suitable theory can be found—or at least sketched—and I think it is a reasonably attractive theory in its own right.
18 syls
checking: What other purposes it might serve, if any, I cannot say.
16 syls
checking: II.
error
checking: Events Are Properties of Spatiotemporal Regions An event is a localised matter of contingent fact.
error
checking: It occurs.
3 syls
checking: It is contingent that it occurs; no event occurs at every possible world.
18 syls
checking: Hence we have nonvacuous counterfactuals about what would have been the case if a given event had not occurred, as we must if we are to place that event in a history of causal dependence.
error
checking: An event occurs in a particular spatiotemporal region.
error
checking: Its region might be small or large; there are collisions of point particles and there are condensations of galaxies, but even the latter occupy regions small by astronomical standards.

19 syls
checking: If an event occurs in a region, it does not occur in any proper part of that region.
18 syls
checking: The whole of the event occupies the whole of its region.
15 syls
checking: Parts of it, but not the whole of it, may occur in parts of its region.
18 syls
checking: Also, an event is unrepeated: it does not occur in two different regions of the world.
error
checking: Thus an "annual event" such as the Grand Final is not an event in the sense of the present theory.
18 syls
checking: As is only right and proper: the Grand Final does not cause or get caused simpliciter.
18 syls
checking: It has different causes and effects in different years, which is to say that the different, unrepeated Grand Finals of the different years are what really have the causes and effects.
18 syls
checking: end p.243 I distinguish occurring in a region and within a region.
error
checking: An event occurs within every region that includes the region in which it occurs; and it occurs in the region that is the intersection of all regions within which it occurs.
18 syls
checking: We might also say that it is occurring in every region that is part of the region in which it occurs; and that it occurs in the region that is the mereological sum of all regions in which it is occurring.
18 syls
checking: To any event there corresponds a property of regions: the property that belongs to all and only those spatiotemporal regions, of this or any other possible world, in which that event occurs.
20 syls
checking: Such a property belongs to exactly one region of any world where the event occurs, and there are some such worlds.
18 syls
checking: It belongs to no region of any world where the event does not occur, and there are some of those worlds also.
19 syls
checking: If a property of regions satisfies the conditions just stated, it may or may not correspond to an event.
18 syls
checking: But at least it is formally eligible to do so.
15 syls
checking: By a property I mean simply a class—any class.
14 syls
checking: 2 To have the property is to belong to the class.
error
checking: All the things that have the property, whether actual or merely possible, belong.
20 syls
checking: My point in  using the word "property" is simply to emphasise that we are dealing with a class that may have otherworldly things, unactualised possibilia, among its members.
error
checking: (It might even, in the case of mathematical properties such as oddness, have unworldly members that are not part of any world.
18 syls
checking: ) The property that corresponds to an event, then, is the class of all regions—at most one per world— where that event occurs.
18 syls
checking: end p.244 Two events can occur in exactly the same region.
error
checking: An electron's presence in a field can cause its acceleration; radiation of two frequencies can reverberate throughout the same cavity; two chemical reactions can go on in the same flask.
18 syls
checking: More fancifully, there might be goblins made of a sort of matter that passes through our sort without any interaction, and a battle of goblins might occur in the very same region as this conference (the 1981 Conference of the Australasian Association of Philosophy, where this paper was first read).
error
checking: But in each case it would have been possible for one of the two events to occur without the other.
18 syls
checking: It would have been contrary to law, in some cases, but I take it that the laws of nature themselves are contingent.
18 syls
checking: However, I can think of no plausible case of two events such that, necessarily, for any region, one occurs in that region iff the other does.
18 syls
checking: Two such inseparables would be causally indistinguishable on a counterfactual analysis of causation, so it is hard to see how my treatment of causation could possibly need them both.
error
checking: I shall therefore take it that for any two events there is some region of some world where one occurs and the other does not.
18 syls
checking: That region has the property corresponding to one event.
16 syls
checking: It lacks the property corresponding to the other.
14 syls
checking: So the two events correspond to two different properties.
16 syls
checking: Our correspondence between events and properties of regions is therefore one-to-one.
18 syls
checking: A one-to-one correspondence is an opportunity for reduction, and I see no reason why events are needed as irreducible elements of being.
19 syls
checking: Therefore, I propose to identify events with their corresponding properties.
18 syls
checking: An event is a property, or in other words a class, of spatio-temporal regions.
error
checking: It satisfies my conditions of formal eligibility by containing one region each from some worlds, none from others, and never more than one from the same world.
18 syls
checking: It occurs if and where and when there is a region that is a member of it.
18 syls
checking: Not just any property meeting the conditions given is to count as an event.
18 syls
checking: I have said what kind of things events are—namely, formally eligible properties of regions—but not which things of that kind are events.
19 syls
checking: The latter parts of the paper will address that question, though all I say will still fall sadly short of a precise necessary and sufficient condition for eventhood.
18 syls
checking: I am relying on the assumptions (1) that regions are individuals which are parts of possible worlds, and (2) that no region is part of two different worlds.
error
checking: Those assumptions are controversial, but I need not defend them here.
17 syls
added: Those assumptions are controversial, but I need not defend them here.
checking: Those who doubt them need only retreat to a more complicated set-theoretic construction of properties—as functions that end p.245 assign to each world the set of things that have that property at that world—whereupon what I say will go through essentially unchanged.
error
checking: My proposal resembles that of Richard Montague, on which events are taken as certain properties of times.
18 syls
checking: 3 The event occurs at a certain time at a certain world iff the property which is that event belongs, at that world, to that time.
error
checking: Thus he identifies the event with the property of being a time when that event occurs.
18 syls
checking: I think my proposal has two minor advantages.
14 syls
checking: (1) In view of Relativity, it is not altogether clear what sort of thing a time is.
error
checking: (2) Given that a Montague event occurs at a certain time at a certain world, we must work to recover the place where it occurs; given that one of my events occurs in a region of a world, its place is given immediately.
error
checking: My proposal also resembles the suggestion that events might simply be identified with regions, or perhaps with regions including all that occupies them.
19 syls
checking: That has been suggested by several authors, usually with some acknowledgement that what they suggest does not conform to normal usage.
21 syls
checking: 4 We do usually think that two different events might occur in the very same region; not so, of course, if we identify events with their regions.
error
checking: If this conference is its region, and a battle of goblins is its region, and the conference and the battle are the same region, then the battle and the  conference are a single event.
18 syls
checking: You might like the idea of treating events as regions, and yet you might insist on distinguishing these two events.
18 syls
checking: If so, you might want to say that one event is the region qua conference venue, the other is the very same region qua battlefield.
19 syls
checking: And you might want to say that they are identical, yet they are to be distinguished.
18 syls
checking: In a similar frame of mind, you might want to say that Russell qua philosopher and Russell qua politician are identical, yet they are to be distinguished.
21 syls
checking: You really should end p.246 not say such things: nothing may be distinguished in any way whatsoever from itself.
error
checking: Yet we may sympathise with your inclination, and provide for it legitimately as follows.
error
checking: Russell qua philosopher is Russell-taken-in-intension: the Russell of our world, taken together with the Russells of other worlds who are his philosophical counterparts.
error
checking: Likewise for Russell qua politician, except that instead of the philosophical counterparts we take the political counterparts.
22 syls
checking: So far as this world is concerned, there is no difference between the two Russells-in-intension; their thisworldly members really are identical.
18 syls
checking: But the otherworldly members differ, since our Russell has many philosophical-but-not-political and political-but-not-philosophical counterparts.
18 syls
checking: So the two Russells-in-intension, taken entire as classes spread over many worlds, really do differ.
error
checking: Likewise for a pair of regions-in-intension such as this region qua conference venue and the same region qua battlefield: their thisworldly members are identical, but they differ by having different otherworldly members.
error
checking: My events are exactly such regions-in-intension, consisting of regions of many worlds united by suitable relations of similarity.
error
checking: If events are properties, understood as classes with members from many worlds, then you might wish to say that an event exists whether or not it occurs: like a number, it exists necessarily, from the standpoint of every world, though it is not part of any world.
19 syls
checking: Or you might instead say that an event exists at just those worlds where it occurs; or even that it does not fully exist at any world, since no world holds all of it.
18 syls
checking: I think these are merely verbal questions.
10 syls
checking: We may as well leave them unsettled; nothing hangs on them.
14 syls
checking: Never mind whether it is contingent that an event exists; it is at any rate contingent that an event occurs.
18 syls
checking: Also, I do not think it would be appropriate to deny the name "event" to those events that do not occur in our own world.
18 syls
checking: After all, they are of a kind with the events that do actually occur.
18 syls
checking: Others may prefer a different terminology, on which "events" are the ones that actually occur, and the rest are called something else.
18 syls
checking: It matters not—the terminologies are intertranslatable.

checking: 5 Likewise an event is essentially a death iff, necessarily, that event occurs in a region only if someone dies throughout that region, and not throughout any larger one.
error
checking: Such a region will be the location of a final temporal segment of the victim, beginning just when he starts to die.
19 syls
checking: (The vagueness of just when he starts to die infects our classification of events with vagueness, but there's no harm in that.
19 syls
checking: ) And so on for a wide range of essential classifications.
16 syls
checking: These will include some made from single verbs, and others made from more complex predicate phrases—even infinitely complex ones.
18 syls
checking: Thus we say what it would mean (whether or not it is ever true) that some event essentially is a vibrating-of-a-steel-gong-of-so-andso-size-and-shape-at-so-and-so-frequency.
18 syls
checking: (When I use predicate phrases to define essential classifications of events, I am not making any claim of "conceptual priority," whatever that might mean.
19 syls
checking: If the predicates in turn are definable in terms of the classification of events, we have nothing worse than a circle of interdefinables.
21 syls
checking: Such  circles do not suffice to eliminate all the interdefined terms at once, of course, but they may nevertheless be useful collections of analytic truths.
error
checking: ) We can also say what it would mean (whether or not it is ever true) for an event to essentially involve Socrates.
18 syls
checking: It does so iff, necessarily, it occurs in a region only if Socrates is present there—either the Socrates of our world, or else some otherworldly Socrates who is a counterpart of ours.
error
checking: 6 (The vagueness of the counterpart relation infects the classification with vagueness, but again we needn't mind.
error
checking: ) Likewise, combining classification by predicates and by individuals, an event would be essentially a death of Socrates iff, necessarily, it occurs in a region only if Socrates dies throughout that region.
21 syls
checking: Perhaps we should say (for reasons to be considered later) that the individuals essentially involved in events are not whole persisting people but temporal segments of them.
22 syls
checking: But if so, that doesn't change the definition of involvement: for instance an event essentially involves a certain temporal segment of end p.248 Socrates iff, necessarily, that event occurs in a region only if that segment, or a counterpart of it, is present there.
error
checking: We can also say what it would mean for an event to have its location, or a partial specification of its location, essentially.
19 syls
checking: It essentially occurs in region R iff, necessarily, it occurs in a region only if that region is R, or a counterpart of R. It essentially occurs within the twentieth century iff, necessarily, it occurs only within the twentieth century, or a counterpart thereof.
error
checking: Not only does an event have built-in necessary conditions for its occurrence; it has built-in necessary and sufficient conditions.
18 syls
checking: That is just to say that there is a property that belongs to all and only the regions of this and other worlds where it occurs; and that is just to say that these regions comprise a class.
18 syls
checking: If we could manage to express that property, and thus state necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of an event, then not only could we classify that event by its essence; we could specify it uniquely.
19 syls
checking: It would be the unique event such that, necessarily, it occurs in a region R iff .

0 syls
checking: You might hope that an essential specification of an event could easily be extracted from the sort of nominalisation whereby we standardly denote it.
18 syls
checking: Suppose we denote an event by a nominalisation: "the F-ing of A at T." Let f be the property expressed by the predicate F, let a be the individual denoted by A, and let t be the time denoted by T. (The denoting needn't be rigid.
error
checking: ) The nominalisation denotes an event by way of the "constitutive" triple of f, a, and t; further, the occurrence of that event is somehow connected with the fact that property f belongs to individual a at time t.7 (How does a property belong to an individual at a time?
error
checking: Perhaps because it is really a property of time-slices, or perhaps it is really a relation of individuals to times.
19 syls
checking: ) Then it is all too easy to assume that the triple gives us an essential specification of the denoted event.
20 syls
checking: That is, we have the hypothesis that "the F-ing of A at T" denotes the event such that, necessarily, it occurs iff f belongs to a at t. (Iff so, then presumably it occurs in the region occupied by a at t.) I think this will not do, at least not given the needs of a counterfactual analysis of causation.
19 syls
checking: Sometimes, perhaps, an event can indeed be essentially specified in this way by means of a constitutive property, end p.249 individual, and time.
18 syls
checking: But it is not so in general for the events we denote by nominalisations, and it is not so in general for causes and effects.
error
checking: The trouble is that an event with such a rich essence is a fragile thing.
18 syls
checking: It is hard to change it without destroying it.
12 syls
checking: It cannot occur at any but its constitutive time, it cannot involve any but its constitutive individual, and it cannot occur without something being an instance of its constitutive property.
error
checking: The causes and effects whereof we ordinarily speak are more robust than that.
error
checking: The clearest difficulty concerns the alleged constitutive time.
error
checking: It is one thing to postpone an event, another to cancel it.
17 syls
added: It is one thing to postpone an event, another to cancel it.
checking: A cause without which it would have occurred later, or sooner, is not a cause without which it would not have occurred at all.
18 syls
checking: Who would dare be a doctor, if the hypothesis under consideration were right?
20 syls
checking: You might manage to keep your patient alive until 4:12, when otherwise he would have died at 4:08.
error
checking: You would then have caused his death.
7 syls
checking: For his death  was, in fact, his death at 4:12.
error
checking: If that time is essential, his death is an event that would not have occurred had he died at 4:08, as he would have done without your action.
19 syls
checking: That will not do.
4 syls
checking: (The point is due to Ken Kress.
7 syls
checking: For further discussion, see Postscript E to "Causation," in this volume.
18 syls
checking: ) Of course, we should not bounce off to the other extreme, and suppose that the death of the patient is an event such that, necessarily, it occurs iff he dies, never mind when and how.
18 syls
checking: That would mean that the only way to cause someone's death would be to rob him of immortality, which is quite wrong also.
18 syls
checking: Someone could die any of many different deaths, but not just any difference of time is enough to make the difference.
18 syls
checking: The alleged constitutive individual also is problematic.
error
checking: It is by no means clear that an event involving an individual always involves that individual essentially.
19 syls
checking: Sometimes we are entitled to think of individuals as interchangeable parts.
21 syls
checking: One member only of the firing squad got live ammunition, the rest fired blanks.
18 syls
checking: The shooting was in fact done by Ted, but it could very well have been done by Ned instead.
18 syls
checking: A cause without which someone else would have fired the fatal shot is not, or at any rate not clearly, a cause without which that very shooting—the one that was in fact a shooting by Ted—would not have taken place.
18 syls
checking: It is not something on which that event depends.
12 syls
checking: Even the alleged constitutive property is not beyond suspicion.
error
checking: Perhaps any change, or any death, or any shooting, is such essentially.
20 syls
checking: Perhaps not.
3 syls
checking: But what if some much more specific, detailed predicate appears in the nominalisation?
18 syls
checking: Sebastian strolled because he had plenty end p.250 of time.
error
checking: Had he been delayed, the walking that was in fact a strolling might rather have been a striding.
18 syls
checking: It might not even have been a walking, but rather a running.
16 syls
checking: That is not to say, not clearly, that it would not have occurred at all.
17 syls
added: That is not to say, not clearly, that it would not have occurred at all.
checking: So, while it is clear enough what it would mean to specify events essentially, often that does not seem to be what we really do.
21 syls
checking: At any rate, it is not what we do when we specify events by means of our standard nominalisations.
18 syls
checking: Indeed, it may be no easy thing to refer to events by means of essential specifications of them.
18 syls
checking: It would be downright impossible, if the event occurs in one but not both of two absolutely indiscernible regions of some world; and any event that could occur in a world of eternal recurrence is an event that occurs in two such regions.
18 syls
checking: We might restrict our ambitions, ignore such especially troublesome worlds, and hope we could state a condition for the occurrence of an event which would be necessary and sufficient so far as the better-behaved worlds are concerned.
18 syls
checking: That would not quite be an essential specification, but it would approximate to one.
21 syls
checking: Even that much would, I fear, be a tall order; though the more we restrict ourselves, the easier it gets.
18 syls
checking: Ignoring the worlds infected by indiscernibility might be only a beginning.
error
checking: If we restrict our attention to a small range of worlds sufficiently similar to actuality, we might have some hope of success at stating a condition that would be necessary and sufficient, so far as worlds in the range were concerned, for occurrence of a certain event.
19 syls
checking: Of course, it would not distinguish events that differ only with respect to regions of worlds outside the range.
18 syls
checking: Thus it could not be used to specify one event determinately.
error
checking: But often we find it tolerable to leave some indeterminacy in our specifications of things.
error
checking: Where exactly does the outback begin?
10 syls
checking: Nobody knows; not because it's a secret, but because we've never bothered to settle exactly what "the outback" denotes.
19 syls
checking: And yet we know, near enough, what we're talking about.
14 syls
checking: It might be the same way with our best feasible approximations to essential specifications of events: the specification might be ambiguous between many events that more-or-less coincide throughout nearby worlds but differ at more distant worlds.
18 syls
checking: That might be near enough to determinate reference to meet (some of) our needs.
18 syls
checking: We might specify events that way; but then again we might not.
16 syls
checking: Often, for instance when we denote events by means of the standard nominalisations, our specifications do not even approximate to being essential.
error
checking: Likewise, while it is clear enough what it would mean to classify events essentially, it seems that very often we do not do that either.
18 syls
checking: We end p.251 specify and we classify actually occurring events in part by descriptions that fit these events accidentally.
error
checking: The event does fit the description, but that very event might have occurred without  fitting the description.
19 syls
checking: The event is a class consisting of one region of this world together with various regions of other worlds wherein the event might have occurred.
19 syls
checking: What goes on in the former region fits the description, but what goes on in some of the latter regions does not.
18 syls
checking: The description may imply something about the essential classification of the event it describes, but it is not exhausted by that information.
20 syls
checking: There are many ways an event might be accidentally classified, and I cannot hope to give a complete inventory.
18 syls
checking: (1) For events, as for anything else, we can always hoke up thoroughly artificial descriptions: "the event that is the Big Bang if Essendon will win the Grand Final, the birth of Calvin Coolidge if not".
error
checking: (2) We might classify it in part by its causes or its effects: "Fred's sunstroke," "what Fred did to bring it about that the window is open".
error
checking: (3) We might classify it with reference to its place in a conventional system: "Fred's signalling for a left turn," "Fred's signing of the cheque".
error
checking: (4) We might conjoin an accidental circumstance to an essential classification.
error
checking: A certain famous event was essentially a fiddling, let us assume, but only accidentally was it a fiddling while Rome burned.
19 syls
checking: I have already suggested that classifications by "constitutive" triples may be accidental, indeed that all three terms of the triple may be inessential.
error
checking: (5) We can classify or specify an event by its time, or more generally by the (exact or approximate) location of the region in which it actually occurs, even if it could have occurred at a somewhat different time and place.
error
checking: (6) Though there may be some events that involve "constitutive individuals" essentially, I have argued that others—as in the case of the firing squad—involve individuals accidentally.
error
checking: (7) Likewise for "constitutive properties".
error
checking: I don't deny that some event with a richly detailed essence might be essentially a strolling, so that necessarily it occurs only in a region wherein someone strolls.
18 syls
checking: But some less fragile event might be only accidentally a strolling; it might be a strolling that could have been a striding.
19 syls
checking: At the end of the next section, I shall consider the relation between essential and accidental strollings.
19 syls
checking: (8) If an event essentially involves one individual, it may thereby accidentally involve another.
error
checking: Suppose an event essentially involves a certain soldier, who happens to belong to a certain army.
19 syls
checking: This event cannot occur in regions where there is no counterpart of that soldier, but it can occur where there is a counterpart of the soldier who does end p.252 not belong to a counterpart of that army.
18 syls
checking: Then the event accidentally involves that army, by way of its soldier.
18 syls
checking: Similarly, suppose an event essentially involves a certain temporal personsegment, which is accidentally a segment of Socrates; that would be one way for an event to accidentally involve Socrates.
18 syls
checking: (9) Another possibility for accidental classification turns on nonrigid designation of properties.
error
checking: I persist in thinking that "heat" nonrigidly designates whatever phenomenon it is that occupies a certain role and presents itself to us by causing certain manifestations.
error
checking: 8 In fact, this is molecular motion, but it might have been something else.
error
checking: A world where caloric fluid causes those manifestations is a world where the hot things are the ones with lots of caloric fluid.
18 syls
checking: Then "the loss of heat by the poker" may denote an actually occurring event that is essentially a decreasing of molecular motion, and is only accidentally a loss of heat.
20 syls
checking: This same event might have occurred at a world where caloric fluid is what presents itself as heat, in a region where the poker absorbed caloric fluid while its molecular motion decreased.
18 syls
checking: In any case of accidental classification or specification, the event actually described is one that might have occurred without fitting the given description.
20 syls
checking: Whenever that is so, we must take care with our causal counterfactuals.
error
checking: Consider whether the event of a certain description would or would not have occurred under some counterfactual supposition.
18 syls
checking: It is one thing to say that the event itself would not have occurred; it is a different thing to say that no event fitting the given description would have occurred.
18 syls
checking: For the event might have occurred without fitting the description; or not that event, but another event fitting the description, might have occurred.
18 syls
checking: Many authors, most prominently Davidson, have noted that sentences which do not explicitly mention events often are equivalent to sentences which assert that there occurs (or exists) an event of such-and-such description.
19 syls
checking: 9 We must at least agree that many such equivalences end p.253 hold, whether or not we regard them as somehow revealing underlying logical forms, and whether or not we think they are delivered wholesale in accordance with some nice general schema.
error
checking: The present treatment of events should not be expected to deliver them wholesale, as witness the mathematical sequence that converges although there occurs no event—in the sense I have in mind—which is its converging.
18 syls
checking: But many such equivalences do hold, and these should guide us in considering the variety of ways in which events are classified.
error
checking: One reason to insist on accidental classification of events is that with essential classification alone, we do not get the proper equivalences.
19 syls
checking: We get one direction easily enough; if there occurs an event that is essentially an Fing, then in some region of this world an event occurs such that, necessarily, it occurs in a region only if something F-s there; so something F-s.
18 syls
checking: But the converse direction will often fail.
11 syls
checking: If something F-s, it does not in general follow that there occurs an event that is essentially an F-ing.
18 syls
checking: The most that follows (and even that not in full generality, as witness the converging sequence) is that there occurs an event which, in some way or other, essentially or accidentally, is an F-ing.
18 syls
checking: If Nero fiddles while Rome burns, I agree that an event occurs which is essentially a fiddling; and an event occurs which is accidentally a fiddling while Rome burns, since the aforementioned fiddling does occur while Rome burns.
18 syls
checking: But for reasons to be considered later, I doubt that there occurs any event which is essentially a fiddling while Rome burns, and which could not have occurred under happier circumstances.
19 syls
checking: The foregoing discussion contributes only in a negative way to answering the question which ones among the formally eligible properties of regions are the events.
18 syls
checking: We cannot answer that question correctly by first investigating our event descriptions, then taking events to be those properties of regions that such descriptions can specify essentially; because our specifications of events may be largely accidental.
18 syls
checking: end p.254 IV.
error
checking: Events Stand in Logical Relations Let us say that event e implies event f iff, necessarily, if e occurs in a region then also f occurs in that region.
19 syls
checking: Considered as classes, event e is a subclass included in class f. Just because we can define a relation, it doesn't follow that there are any instances of it.
error
checking: A theory of events might include the thesis that no events imply other events.
18 syls
checking: That was my own view until recently, but now I think it should be rejected.
20 syls
checking: John says "Hello".
4 syls
checking: He says it rather too loudly.
8 syls
checking: Arguably there is one event that occurs which is essentially a saying-"Hello" and only accidentally loud; it would have occurred even if John had spoken softly.
18 syls
checking: Arguably there is a second event that implies, but is not implied by, the first.
19 syls
checking: This event is essentially a saying-"Hello"-loudly, and it would not have occurred if John had said "Hello" but said it softly.
18 syls
checking: Both events actually occur, but the second could not have occurred without the first.
18 syls
checking: We have two descriptions: "John's saying 'Hello' " and "John's saying 'Hello' loudly".
19 syls
checking: But it does not follow from this alone that we have two events to describe.
19 syls
checking: The second description as well as the first might denote the first event, since the second description might describe the first event in part accidentally.
18 syls
checking: Alternatively, the first description as well as the second might denote the second event, since the first description might describe the second event by less than the whole of its essence.
19 syls
checking: Indeed, even if there are two different events, it still does not follow that one description denotes one and the other denotes the other.
19 syls
checking: If both descriptions are somewhat vague or ambiguous, it could be that both denote both.
18 syls
checking: The real reason why we need both events, regardless of which description denotes which, is that they differ causally.
18 syls
checking: An adequate causal account of what happens cannot limit itself to either one of the two.
18 syls
checking: The first event (the weak one) caused Fred to greet John in return.
15 syls
checking: The second one  (the strong one) didn't.
error
checking: If the second one had not occurred—if John hadn't said "Hello" so loudly— the first one still might have, in which case Fred still would have returned John's greeting.
error
checking: Also there is a difference on the side of causes: the second event was, and the first wasn't, caused inter alia by John's state of tension.
19 syls
checking: 10 end p.255 We have two different events, causally distinguished.
error
checking: Different, but we needn't count them as distinct.
error
checking: "Distinct" does not mean "non-identical".
10 syls
checking: I and my nose are not identical, but neither are we distinct.
17 syls
added: I and my nose are not identical, but neither are we distinct.
checking: My nose is part-identical to me, identical to part of me.
18 syls
checking: There is a clear sense in which our second event is part of the first: the subclass is part of the class, they are neither identical nor distinct.
18 syls
checking: (Confusingly, by the inverse variation of intension and extension, there is also a sense in which the first event is part of the second.
error
checking: ) Indeed, we dare not count the two as distinct.
11 syls
checking: For their distinctness, plus my theses about causation, would together imply what is surely false: that the first event causes the second.
error
checking: For if the first had not occurred, then the second which implies the first would not have occurred either.
18 syls
checking: Here is a case of non-causal counterfactual dependence—but not between distinct events.
error
checking: We may take it as a general principle that when one event implies another, then they are not distinct and their counterfactual dependence is not causal.
19 syls
checking: There is a persuasive intuition—I was long persuaded by it—that it is wrong to count both the first and the second event because if we do, we count something twice over.
18 syls
checking: I now think that we do this intuition sufficient justice when we say that the first and second events, though not identical, also are not distinct.
18 syls
checking: Compare the equally persuasive intuition that it is double-counting to include both atoms and molecules in our inventory of being—an adequate answer is that the molecules and their atoms are not distinct.
18 syls
checking: There might be two occurrent events that are both implied by some third occurrent event, but that are independent of each other.
error
processed: 5000
checking: Like this: the first event is essentially a saying-"Hello"loudly and is accidentally abrupt; the second is essentially a saying-"Hello"-abruptly, and is accidentally loud; the third event, which implies both the first and the second, is essentially a saying-"Hello"-loudly-and-abruptly.
18 syls
checking: In this case also, the first and second should not be counted as distinct.
18 syls
checking: Therefore they are not eligible to stand in causal dependence.
17 syls
added: Therefore they are not eligible to stand in causal dependence.
checking: But we must beware.
5 syls
checking: Suppose we had an occurrent event with a very rich essence: the unit class of a region of our world.
error
checking: It would imply all the events that occur in that region, none of them would then be distinct, and they would be ineligible to depend causally on one another.
18 syls
checking: That is wrong.
3 syls
checking: If this conference and the battle of goblins occurred in the same region, they would nevertheless be intuitively distinct, and they might perhaps stand in causal dependence.
19 syls
checking: The acceleration of the electron does depend causally on its presence in the field.
error
checking: Therefore there must be a limit on how rich the essence of a genuine event can be.
19 syls
checking: end p.256 Mere unit classes of regions are ruled out, and I should think a good deal else besides.
error
checking: I have argued that we might have two events, one implying the other, such that one is essentially a saying-"Hello"-loudly, and the other is only accidentally a saying-"Hello"-loudly.
18 syls
checking: I suggest that this illustrates one important way in which events come by their accidental classifications.
18 syls
checking: We have, so to speak, a more and a less detailed version of what happens in a region.
18 syls
checking: Both are occurrent events.
error
checking: The more detailed version has a richer essence; the otherworldly regions included in it are fewer and less varied; it is more tightly unified by similarity; there is less variety in the ways it could have occurred.
19 syls
checking: The more detailed version is one, but only one, of the ways in which the less detailed version could have occurred.
18 syls
checking: But it, unlike alternative more detailed versions, happens to be the way the less detailed version actually did occur.
18 syls
checking: In such a case, the essential classification of the occurrent more detailed version carries over to become an accidental classification of the less detailed version.
error
checking: Likewise, I said above that some events are essentially strollings and some are accidentally strollings.
error
checking: The event that is accidentally a strolling is so because it is implied by another event, its more detailed version, which actually occurs and which is essentially a strolling.
18 syls
checking: The accidental strolling has alternative more detailed versions; for instance, it is also implied by a non-occurrent event which is essentially a striding.
18 syls
checking: If that one of the implying  events had been the one that occurred, then the implied event would have been accidentally a striding rather than a strolling.
18 syls
checking: (Above, I noted this implication: if there occurs an event that is essentially an F-ing, then it follows that something F-s.
18 syls
checking: Now we can drop the "essentially," though subject to a proviso.
17 syls
added: Now we can drop the "essentially," though subject to a proviso.
checking: For if there occurs an event that is accidentally an F-ing, provided it comes by this accidental classification in the way just discussed, then there occurs another event that is essentially an F-ing, and again it follows that something F-s.
18 syls
checking: ) Similarly, if some occurrent event essentially involves some individual, then an event that it implies—its less detailed version—accidentally involves that individual.
error
checking: Consider the shooting that was done by Ted, but might have been done by Ned.
18 syls
checking: How does it involve Ted?
6 syls
checking: Perhaps (but this is not the only possible answer) because it is implied by an occurrent event, its more detailed version, that was a shooting essentially done by Ted.
18 syls
checking: Can it be, as I thought for a time, that accidental classifications of events always work this way?
19 syls
checking: Can we say in general that they are end p.257 essential classifications of the occurrent more detailed version, carried over via implication?
error
checking: If so, then every accidental classification of one event would have to be an essential classification of another.
19 syls
checking: But some classifications seem so very accidental that no event could have them essentially.
19 syls
checking: Consider accidental classifications in terms of circumstances.
19 syls
checking: There is an event that is accidentally a fiddling while Rome burns, but I doubt that any event is essentially a fiddling while Rome burns.
18 syls
checking: And the example can be made even more extreme.
13 syls
checking: There is an event that is accidentally classifiable as follows: it is a fiddling in the presence of a boy whose grandson will first set foot on the moon.
18 syls
checking: Surely no event is essentially that!
11 syls
checking: So we get no unified theory; there must be other ways for events to come by their accidental classifications.
18 syls
checking: For accidental classifications in terms of circumstances, at any rate, it is no mystery how they manage to do it.
18 syls
checking: Again we would be in trouble if we had events with overly rich essences.
18 syls
checking: If the unit classes of regions were counted as events, to take the worst case, then the accidental descriptions of events that happen to occur in the same region would coalesce.
18 syls
checking: If this conference occurs in the same region as a battle of goblins, it would follow that the conference is, albeit accidentally, a battle of goblins.
19 syls
checking: For it would be implied by an occurrent event—namely, the unit class—that is so essentially.
error
checking: That would never do.
5 syls
checking: V. Events Have a Spatiotemporal Mereology We have seen how events may be, in a sense, logical parts of one another.
error
checking: If events are classes, as I propose, then they have a mereology in the way that all classes do: the parts of a class are its subclasses.
error
checking: However, there is a second sense in which events have a mereology, and that will be our business in this section.
error
checking: Regions may be spatio-temporal parts of one another; events are classes of regions; the mereology of the members carries over to the classes, giving us a sense in which events also may be spatiotemporal parts of one another.
error
checking: Each of Sebastian's steps is a spatiotemporal part of his stroll; so is the entire half-stroll performed by the left half of him.
error
checking: Small events that occur in subregions are parts of the big event that occurs in the big region.
error
checking: Let us say that event e is essentially part of event f, iff, necessarily, if f occurs in a region, then also e occurs in a subregion included in that region.
error
checking: (Not necessarily a proper subregion.
error
checking: Therefore an implied event is, in the sense of this definition, essentially part of the implying end p.258 event; though in another sense, the subclass sense, the implying event is part of the implied one.
21 syls
checking: We have already noted this ambiguity.
13 syls
checking: ) However, events need not have their spatiotemporal parts essentially.
error
checking: Sebastian's stroll might have consisted of more steps, or fewer, or the same number but not the very same steps.
18 syls
checking: A war might have consisted of different battles, though the  scope for difference is limited.
20 syls
checking: We need to provide for accidental, as well as essential, spatiotemporal mereology of events.
error
checking: 11 To do so, we may imitate the proposal of the previous section: let the essential mereology of the more detailed occurrent versions carry over via implication to become the accidental mereology of the less detailed versions.
error
checking: Let us say that occurrent event e is part of occurrent event f iff some occurrent event that implies e is essentially part of some occurrent event that implies f. This covers not only the case in which e is essentially part of f, but also the case in which e is only accidentally part of f, and f could have occurred without having e as a part.
error
checking: When one event is part of another, whether essentially or accidentally, they are not identical but they are not distinct either.
22 syls
checking: (Again, they are partly identical.
10 syls
checking: ) The same is true when two events share a part in common though neither is a part of the other.
18 syls
checking: Kim gives the case of someone who writes "Larry," and as part of that event writes "rr".
18 syls
checking: 12 I add that he writes "Larr" and he writes "rry," these being two overlapping events.
error
checking: No two of these four events are distinct.
10 syls
checking: As in the case considered previously of events related by implication (which case is subsumed under the present one), events that are not distinct cannot stand in causal dependence.
18 syls
checking: If the writing of "rr" had not occurred, the writing of "Larry" would not have, but that does not make those two events be cause and effect.
error
checking: Nor can the whole of the writing of "Larr" be a cause on which the writing of "rry" depends, though the first part of it well might be.
error
checking: (Often we do say loosely that event c causes event e when what's true is that one or more parts of c cause one or more parts of e. Thus we might speak of some prolonged self-perpetuating process as its own cause, when really there is no self-causation and it is earlier parts that cause later parts.
18 syls
checking: See Postscript A to "Causation," in this volume.
12 syls
checking: ) Once more we would be in trouble if we had events with overly rich end p.259 essences.
18 syls
checking: If the unit classes of regions were counted as events, it would turn out that whenever one event occurs within the region in which another occurs, the former event is part of the latter.
18 syls
checking: Once we have defined the part-whole relation for events, we can go on as usual to define other mereological notions.
18 syls
checking: Thus events overlap iff they have some event as a common part; an atomic event is one that has no events except itself as parts; an event e is the mereological sum of events f 1 , f 2 , .
error
checking: .
0 syls
checking: .
0 syls
checking: iff e overlaps all and only those events that overlap at least one of the f's; and so on.
error
checking: Then we can ask what principles this mereology of events obeys.
error
checking: Is it like the unrestricted mereology of individuals, in which several individuals always have another individual as their sum?
error
checking: Or is it like the restricted mereology of chairs, in which several chairs seldom, if ever, have another chair as their sum?
error
checking: Or is it in between?
6 syls
checking: I suggest that events are at any rate more amenable to summation than chairs are: a war may be the sum of its battles, a conference may be the sum of its sessions.
20 syls
checking: But I leave open the question whether several events, however miscellaneous, always have another event as their sum.
22 syls
checking: If there is unrestricted summation, then there can be no limit on how large and disconnected and disunified an event may be; whereas if events must have some unity to them, then some attempted summations would fail to yield a genuine event.
18 syls
checking: (Maybe they yield a property of regions which is formally eligible, but not an event.
20 syls
checking: ) It is hard to find arguments to settle the question.
14 syls
checking: Our events are meant to serve as causes and effects; but it seems hard to tell when we can be content to say only that several events are joint causes and separate effects, and when we must also insist on a single event that is their sum.
18 syls
checking: Another question is this: given any subregion of the region in which an event occurs, is there a part of that event which occurs in that subregion?
error
checking: I am inclined to think that there is in the case of a suitable subregion—one with boundaries that are reasonably simple in shape, or that match the boundaries of something within the region—but not in the case of an arbitrary subregion.
error
checking: But again I cannot find arguments to settle the question.

1 syls
checking: The History of Events Is the Whole of History  Suppose we are given the complete history of the world's events: exactly which events occur in exactly which regions, throughout all of space and time.
18 syls
checking: Then no historical information is lacking.
13 syls
checking: No two end p.260 possible worlds could be exactly alike in their histories of events, yet unlike elsewhere in their histories of matters of manifest particular fact.
error
checking: The total history of events implies every historical truth and contradicts every historical falsehood.
18 syls
checking: It must be so, given the four theses about causation and explanation that I took as my starting point.
20 syls
checking: To explain is to give information about the causal history of the explanandum event, and that history is a structure of causally related events.
18 syls
checking: If history is a patchwork of events and nonevents, and if the nonevents are not implicitly given by the history of events, then the nonevents are left out of causal histories.
error
checking: Then they never enter into the explanations of events.
16 syls
checking: But is there really anything in history that is thus isolated, that never plays any part in explaining why any event took place?
19 syls
checking: I do not see what it could be.
8 syls
checking: Not all events involve change.
7 syls
checking: We cannot afford to count the unchanges as nonevents, for the unchanges may be needed to complete causal histories.
error
checking: Indeed, the causal history of an event— an uncontroversial event, an abrupt change—might consist entirely of unchanges.
18 syls
checking: An isolated particle has existed from all eternity; it is unstable, and has at every moment a chance of decaying; eventually it does decay.
18 syls
checking: The decay was caused (probabilistically) by the previous presence, at all earlier times, of the unchanging particle.
error
checking: The causal history that explains this event is entirely changeless.
error
checking: It is a thoroughly uneventful course of events.
14 syls
checking: The need for unchanges as events is urgent in connection with causal theories of perception, memory, persistence over time, and so on.
error
checking: The causal chains required by such theories often will consist simply of something continuing to exist: a travelling signal, a memory trace, a surviving person or a persisting lump of matter.
18 syls
checking: The need is urgent also in connection with causal preemption.
17 syls
added: The need is urgent also in connection with causal preemption.
checking: The preempting cause may cause its effect not because the effect depends directly on the cause, but because the effect depends causally on some intermediate event which in turn depends causally on the preempted cause.
18 syls
checking: (See Postscript E to "Causation," in this volume.
12 syls
checking: ) If we could not count unchanges, there would be realistic cases in which we could find no suitable intermediate event.
error
checking: Terminology is not the issue.
10 syls
checking: If it is abuse of language to call unchanges "events," so be it.
error
checking: The point is that we must have them as causes and effects.
14 syls
checking: This section does not contribute directly to answering the question which among the formally eligible properties of regions are events.
18 syls
checking: But it is indirectly relevant: no adequate demarcation of the events can be end p.261 too restrictive, else it leaves us with not enough events to make up the whole of history.
18 syls
checking: Given the history of events, the whole of history is implicitly given; but not, perhaps, the whole truth about contingent matters.
20 syls
checking: It is an independent, and difficult, question whether two worlds exactly alike in their histories would have to be exactly alike in every way: in their chances, their laws, their modal truths and counterfactuals, their causal relations, and so on.
20 syls
checking: (See the introduction to this volume.
10 syls
checking: ) My present point does not touch that question.
10 syls
checking: I say just that total history supervenes on the history of events, whatever else may or may not supervene in turn on total history.

checking: VII.
error
checking: Events Are Predominantly Intrinsic Consider the alleged event such that, necessarily, it occurs in a region iff (1) that region is located at a certain time t, (2) Xanthippe is present in that region, and (3) at time t, someone dies who has been married to her until that time.
19 syls
checking: 13 I shall call this alleged event the widowing of Xanthippe, since I need a name for it; but I do not mean to suggest (and do not believe) that this is what the phrase would ordinarily denote.
error
checking: (Maybe it would denote the death of Socrates; or maybe no event at all, but rather a certain fact, that is a certain true proposition.
18 syls
checking: ) Condition (3) is entirely  extrinsic.
error
checking: It has nothing to do with the qualitative character of the region in question, and everything to do with what goes on at other times and places.
19 syls
checking: The other conditions are at least partly intrinsic.
14 syls
checking: But they do not go very far toward picking out those regions where the alleged event allegedly occurs.
18 syls
checking: We can devise a more extreme, but also more artificial, case in which a supposed event is almost purely extrinsic in its essence.
18 syls
checking: Begin with some genuine event: this conference, let us say.
16 syls
checking: Define its centennial to be that event—if such it be—such that, necessarily, it occurs in a region R iff the original event occurs in the region which results from shifting R exactly 100 years backward, holding fixed its place, size, and shape.
18 syls
checking: A centennial in this artificial sense is not at all intrinsic.
19 syls
checking: Whether it occurs in a region is completely independent of what things are there, how they are arranged, what they are like, and what they are doing.
18 syls
checking: It is quite unlike a centennial in the ordinary sense: a genuine event wherein some previous event is remembered and celebrated.
18 syls
checking: The qualitative end p.262 character of the region could be anything.
error
checking: (With one exception: it must have a size and shape which the original event could possibly have.
18 syls
checking: ) We can define an intrinsic property of a region as one such that, whenever two possible regions are perfect duplicates, the property belongs to both or neither.
18 syls
checking: Likewise a purely extrinsic property is one such that, for any possible region, there is some possible region which is a perfect duplicate of it and has the property.
18 syls
checking: 14 I think there are no such events as the widowing of Xanthippe or the centennial of this conference.
error
checking: We have the properties of regions, right enough, and they are formally eligible.
18 syls
checking: But they are not events because they are purely or predominantly extrinsic, whereas the properties of regions that are genuine events are predominantly intrinsic.
18 syls
checking: Extrinsic events—or, more generally, events not predominantly intrinsic—are objectionable on three counts.
19 syls
checking: (1) They offend our sense of economy.
error
checking: We would seem to count the death of Socrates twice over in our inventory of events, once as itself and again as (what I am calling) the widowing of Xanthippe.
21 syls
checking: Still more clearly, the centennial of this conference is but a shadow of the conference itself.
19 syls
checking: (2) They stand in relations of noncausal counterfactual dependence to those genuine events in virtue of which they occur.
error
checking: Without the death of Socrates, the widowing of Xanthippe would not have occurred.
error
checking: (She might still have been widowed sooner or later.
12 syls
checking: But recall that the widowing of Xanthippe, as I defined it, had its time essentially.
error
checking: ) Without this conference, its centennial would not occur.
15 syls
checking: What's worse: without its centennial, the conference would not occur.
18 syls
checking: None of these is a genuine case of causal dependence.
15 syls
checking: (3) They also stand in relations of noncausal counterfactual dependence to other genuine events, events logically independent of them.
error
checking: Without the widowing of Xanthippe, the subsequent cooling of Socrates's body would not have occurred.
error
checking: (For in that case he would not have died when he did.
12 syls
checking: ) Without the centennial of this conference 100 years hence, our homeward departures a few days from now would not occur.
error
checking: These also are not genuine cases of causal dependence.
16 syls
checking: Instantaneous and backward causation are not so very easy!
18 syls
checking: The first two objections might be answered by claiming that the events in question are in some sense not distinct.
18 syls
checking: It is a bit hard to say end p.263 why not: in the case of the death of Socrates and the widowing of Xanthippe, either could have occurred without the other.
error
checking: (They are logically, though not counterfactually, independent.
error
checking: ) Further, they occur in nonoverlapping regions.
error
checking: But suppose that some suitable sense of distinctness could be found.
error
checking: That would do nothing at all to answer the third objection, which is therefore the decisive one.
19 syls
checking: Should I say that genuine events must be entirely, not just predominantly, intrinsic?
22 syls
checking: I think not.
3 syls
checking: For if an event were an entirely intrinsic property of regions, then it would have to occur in any duplicate of any region in which it occurs.
18 syls
checking: Suppose it is an event that could occur within some epoch of some world of eternal recurrence—that's not a very strong condition, especially not on the hypothesis that events are entirely intrinsic.
18 syls
checking: But every region within an epoch has duplicates within  all the other epochs.
18 syls
checking: So this event occurs many times over in a single world, contra our stipulation that we are talking about particular events.
18 syls
checking: That stipulation applies even to a world of eternal recurrence; because surely we want to distinguish the events of different epochs, indiscernible though they may be.
19 syls
checking: A similar problem arises from duplication of regions within more ordinary worlds.
19 syls
checking: It may be hard for big regions to be exactly alike in what goes on in them; but remember that submicroscopic events go on in submicroscopic regions, and electron-sized regions will have less opportunity to differ than larger regions do.
18 syls
checking: We don't want a collision of two electrons to be one event that occurs in all regions of the same world where two electrons collide in just that way; rather, we want to distinguish different collisions that occur once each.
18 syls
checking: If the regions do not differ intrinsically, then an event that occurs in one but not all of them cannot be entirely intrinsic.
18 syls
checking: It can be predominantly intrinsic, and that is all I should require.
20 syls
checking: The rejection of overly extrinsic events allows me to return to some unfinished business.
19 syls
checking: Earlier, I asked how an event comes to be accidentally classified as a fiddling while Rome burns; not, I said, because it has an occurrent more detailed version that is essentially a fiddling while Rome burns.
20 syls
checking: Now I can give the reason: the alleged event that is essentially a fiddling while Rome burns would be too extrinsic.
18 syls
checking: I also avoided committing myself to the existence of genuine events which essentially involve Socrates; that is, which cannot occur except in a region where our Socrates, or a counterpart of him, is present.
20 syls
checking: Therefore, I also could not commit myself to the existence of events that involve Socrates accidentally by having occurrent more detailed versions that involve him essentially.
19 syls
checking: Now I can give the reason: being a counterpart of Socrates is rather an extrinsic matter.
18 syls
checking: Counterparts are end p.264 united by similarity, and the similarity in question may be largely extrinsic.
error
checking: This is so especially on counterpart relations which stress match of origins: Socrates might have been—some counterpart of him is—a dimwitted and taciturn politician, most noted for his good looks and slender build; but only if his origins had been more or less exactly as they actually were.
20 syls
checking: I am less of an enthusiast for match of origins than most philosophers of modality; nevertheless, I must agree that it often carries a lot of weight.
21 syls
checking: And if similarities in respect of one's role in society and in history also carry weight in making counterparts, as I think they sometimes do, those too are extrinsic.
19 syls
checking: The origins and role of Socrates are not intrinsic even to Socrates taken as a whole.
18 syls
checking: Still less are they intrinsic to the temporal part of him whereby he is present in a region and involved there in some event.
18 syls
checking: So the property of having present in it a counterpart of Socrates is not an intrinsic property of a region; so an alleged event that essentially involved Socrates would be to that extent extrinsic.
20 syls
checking: I am not sure whether it would be extrinsic enough to deserve rejection.
20 syls
checking: (One worry about it is needless, I think.
11 syls
checking: We might fear that any extrinsic element in an event will give rise to cases of noncausal counterfactual dependence.
18 syls
checking: Suppose that Socrates is essentially the outcome of a certain event of conception, and that his death is essentially his.
18 syls
checking: Then his death is essentially preceded by his conception.
16 syls
checking: Had his conception not occurred, his death would not have—because then no death could have been his.
18 syls
checking: But this time the dependence does seem causal, so we have no problem.
17 syls
added: But this time the dependence does seem causal, so we have no problem.
checking: Is there perhaps a new problem: causal dependence between indistinct events?
18 syls
checking: No; there is a sense in which the death implies the conception, and I did say that when one event implies another in a certain sense they are not distinct and not eligible to stand in causal dependence, but the two senses are not the same.
18 syls
checking: Nothing I said detracts from the distinctness, and eligibility for dependence, of two events that occur in nonoverlapping regions.
error
checking: ) Can we afford to reject events that essentially involve Socrates?
19 syls
checking: That depends on whether we can do without them.
12 syls
checking: Certainly some events involve Socrates at least accidentally.
18 syls
checking: But can we find any way for an event to involve Socrates accidentally if none involves him essentially?
22 syls
checking: Of course it will not do to say that he is involved just by being present in the region where the event actually occurs—what if those goblins are present in the region of this conference?
19 syls
checking: Hence my rather cumbersome suggestion about involvement via a temporal segment.
18 syls
checking: It is not necessary that counterpart relations must work in the same way for the parts as for the whole, or that the counterparts of the parts must be  end p.265 parts of the counterpart of the whole.
18 syls
checking: I find it somewhat plausible that a counterpart relation for temporal segments of people could work more by intrinsic similarity and less by origins or roles than a counterpart relation for whole people does.
20 syls
checking: If so, I have less difficulty with an event that essentially involves a person-segment than with one that essentially involves a person.
18 syls
checking: Now suppose we have a death that involves a certain person-segment.
17 syls
added: Now suppose we have a death that involves a certain person-segment.
checking: (Whether essentially or accidentally doesn't matter; if we have one that involves it accidentally, we have another that involves it essentially.
error
checking: ) Now suppose that in fact this segment is part of Socrates.
15 syls
checking: Accidentally so: not all its counterparts are parts of his.
16 syls
checking: Now at last we've got Socrates involved in his own death, and in a way that bypasses any unduly extrinsic events.
18 syls
checking: I wouldn't say no to a simpler method!

error
checking: I do not deny that some events are disjunctions of others.
error
checking: An event that is essentially a stamping might, for instance, be the disjunction of one event that is essentially a stamping-the-leftfoot and another that is essentially a stamping-the-right-foot.
18 syls
checking: But I do not think that just any class will have a disjunction.
error
checking: The disjuncts must not be too miscellaneously varied.
error
checking: In calling an alleged event disjunctive, as opposed to saying that it is the disjunction of such-and-such, I mean that it would be the disjunction of some disjuncts that are overly varied.
error
checking: An example might be the supposed disjunction of one event that is essentially a walking and another that is essentially a talking.
error
checking: Disjunctive events are prima facie open to the same three objections that I raised against extrinsic events.
error
checking: (1) They offend against economy.
error
checking: To count both disjunction and disjunct looks like counting the same thing twice.
error
checking: But to this an adequate reply is that the two are not distinct, by definitions already given.
18 syls
checking: (2) They stand in relations of noncausal counterfactual dependence with their logical relatives, namely their disjuncts.
error
checking: Without the disjunction, no disjunct could have occurred.
error
checking: Without the occurrent disjunct, the disjunction would not end p.266 have occurred (except in special cases where some other disjunct would have occurred instead).
error
checking: It is an adequate reply that these are not cases of counterfactual dependence between distinct events.
error
checking: (It is just as well that these two objections fail.

11 syls

error
checking: Without it, Fred's talking would not have occurred, and neither would Ted's laughing.
18 syls
checking: So this disjunctive event also causes Ted to laugh.
error
checking: That is intuitively wrong.
8 syls
checking: No such event causes Ted's laughing, or anything else.
15 syls
checking: Given the theses I took as my starting point, that can only be because there is no such event.
19 syls
checking: Hence disjunctive events are to be rejected.
error
checking: This may seem too hasty.
6 syls
checking: It may seem that there are some disjunctive events that we dare not lose, because they are indispensable as causes and effects.
error
checking: Suppose that a certain poker cools down; that is, it loses heat.
16 syls
checking: Suppose also that I am right to say that "heat" is not a rigid designator; heat is whatever property it is that occupies a certain causal role, and so might be one property or might be another.
error
checking: So there are many quite different ways that the poker might lose heat, depending on what sort of world it is in.
20 syls
checking: (It or its counterpart.
6 syls

checking: So it seems that losing heat is quite a disjunctive  affair; and what's worse, extrinsic, since whether one property or another occupies the heat-role depends on what goes on throughout the world in question, not just on the region of it where the poker is.
error
checking: All the same, isn't the loss of heat by the poker a perfectly good event?
error
checking: Isn't it a cause of the poker's slight contraction, and an effect of my taking the poker out of the fire?
error
checking: I agree that the loss of heat by the poker is a perfectly good event.
18 syls
checking: But it is not disjunctive, so we needn't fear to lose it if we reject disjunctive events.

13 syls
checking: Twice over: both because it is disjunctive and because the disjuncts are excessively extrinsic.
error
checking: But the perfectly good event which is the loss of heat by the poker is specified as such accidentally, not essentially.
18 syls
checking: It is essentially a decreasing of molecular motion.
17 syls
added: It is essentially a decreasing of molecular motion.
checking: This event does not occur in otherworldly regions where the poker loses heat by losing caloric fluid.
18 syls
checking: But it does occur in regions where the molecular motion decreases and yet the poker does not lose heat, these being regions of worlds where something besides molecular motion is what occupies the heat-role.
19 syls
checking: In those worlds, of course, the event fails to fits its thisworldly accidental description as a loss of heat.
error
checking: Likewise in general.
6 syls
checking: Whenever some term nonrigidly designates the occupant of a role, and that role could be occupied in a variety of ways, the term becomes unsuitable for essential specification of events.
error
checking: If being fragile means having some or another basis for a disposition to break when struck, and if many different properties could serve as such bases (under this- or otherworldly laws), then no genuine event is essentially classifiable as the window's being fragile.

checking: There are pain events, no doubt of it; but they are pain events only accidentally, just as pain itself is a property that only contingently occupies its role and deserves its name.
22 syls
checking: Essentially, the events are firings of neurons, perhaps—unless "firing" and "neuron" also are terms for occupants of roles, in which case we must get more physical before we finally reach an essential classification.

checking: end p.269 end p.270  Part Seven Dependence and Decision end p.271 end p.272 Twenty-Four Veridical Hallucination and Prosthetic Vision I I see.
error
checking: Before my eyes various things are present and various things are going on.
19 syls
checking: The scene before my eyes causes a certain sort of visual experience in me, thanks to a causal process involving light, the retina, the optic nerve, and the brain.
20 syls
checking: The visual experience so caused more or less matches the scene before my eyes.
19 syls
checking: All this goes on in much the same way in my case as in the case of other people who see.
19 syls
checking: And it goes on in much the same way that it would have if the scene before my eyes had been visibly different, though in that case the visual experience produced would have been different.
18 syls
checking: How much of all this is essential to seeing?
12 syls
checking: II It is not far wrong to say simply that someone sees if and only if the scene before his eyes causes matching visual experience.
error
checking: So far as I know, there are no counterexamples to this in our ordinary life.
error
checking: Shortly we shall consider some that arise under extraordinary circumstances.
18 syls
checking: end p.273 But first, what do we mean by "matching visual experience"?
error
checking: What goes on in the brain (or perhaps the soul) is not very much like what goes on before the eyes.
18 syls
checking: They cannot match in the way that a scale model matches its prototype, or anything like that.
18 syls
checking: Rather, visual experience has informational content about the scene before the eyes, and it matches the scene to the extent that its content is correct.
19 syls
checking: Visual experience is a state characterised by its typical causal role, and its role is to participate in a double causal dependence.
error
checking: Visual experience depends on the scene before the eyes,1 and the subject's beliefs about that scene depend in turn partly on his visual experience.
error
checking: The content of the experience is, roughly, the content of the belief it tends to produce.
19 syls
checking: The matter is more complicated, however.
12 syls
checking: The same visual experience will have a different impact on the beliefs of different subjects, depending on what they believed beforehand.
18 syls
checking: (And on other differences between them, e.g. differences of intelligence.
18 syls
checking: ) Holmes will believe more on the basis of a given visual experience than Watson; and Watson in turn will believe more than someone will who suspects that he has fallen victim to a field linguist no less powerful than deceitful.
20 syls
checking: 2 We should take the range of prior states that actually exist among us, and ask what is common to the impact of a given visual experience on all these states.
error
checking: Only if a certain belief would be produced in almost every case may we take its content as part of the content of the visual experience.
18 syls
checking: (The more stringently we take "almost every," the more we cut down the content of the visual experience and the more of its impact we attribute to unconscious inference; for our purposes, we need not consider how that line ought to be drawn.
18 syls
checking: ) Beliefs produced by visual experience are in large part self-ascriptive: the subject believes not only that the world is a certain way but also that he himself is situated in the world in a certain way.
error
checking: To believe that the scene before my eyes is stormy is the same as to believe that I am facing a stormy part of the world.
18 syls
checking: Elsewhere3 I have argued that the objects of such beliefs should be taken, and that the objects of end p.274 all beliefs may be taken, as properties which the subject self-ascribes.
error
checking: Hence the content of visual experience likewise consists of properties—properties which the subject will self-ascribe if the visual experience produces its characteristic sort of belief.
20 syls
checking: The content is correct, and the visual  experience matches the scene before the eyes, to the extent that the subject has the properties that comprise the content of his visual experience.
18 syls
checking: Equivalently we might follow Hintikka's scheme and take the content of visual experience as a set of alternative possibilities.
error
checking: 4 A modification is desirable, however, in view of the selfascriptive character of visually produced belief.
error
checking: We should take these visual alternatives not as possible worlds but as possible individuals-situated-in-worlds.
18 syls
checking: The visual experience characteristically produces in the subject the belief that he himself belongs to this set of alternative possible individuals.
18 syls
checking: Matching then means that the subject is, or at least closely resembles, a member of his alternative set.
18 syls
checking: Not all of the content of visual experience can be characterised in terms of the beliefs it tends to produce.
error
checking: It is part of the content that the duck-rabbit look like a duck or a rabbit, but the belief produced is that there is no duck and no rabbit but only paper and ink.
18 syls
checking: However, aspects of the content that do not show up in the produced belief also are irrelevant to our task of saying what it is for visual experience to match the scene before the eyes.
18 syls
checking: We can therefore ignore them.
7 syls
checking: III I shall not dwell on the question whether it is possible to see even if the scene before the eyes does not cause matching visual experience.
error
checking: Three sorts of examples come to mind.
9 syls
checking: (1) Perhaps someone could see without having visual experience.
error
checking: He would need something that more or less played the role of visual experience; but this substitute might not be visual experience, either because it played the role quite imperfectly5 or because it is not what normally plays the role in human end p.275 beings (or in some other natural kind to which the subject in question belongs).
20 syls
checking: 6 (2) Perhaps someone could see in whom the scene before the eyes causes non-matching visual experience, provided that the failure of match is systematic and that the subject knows how to infer information about the scene before the eyes from this non-matching visual experience.
error
checking: (3) Perhaps someone could see in whom the scene elsewhere than before the eyes causes visual experience matching that scene, but not matching the scene before the eyes (if such there be).
error
checking: I do not find these examples clear one way or the other, and therefore I shall consider them no further.
18 syls
checking: They will not meet the conditions for seeing that follow, wherefore I claim only sufficiency and not necessity for those conditions.
error
checking: Two further preliminaries.
8 syls
checking: (1) My analysandum is seeing in a strong sense that requires a relation to the external scene.
error
checking: Someone whose visual experience is entirely hallucinatory does not see in this strong sense.
21 syls
checking: I take it that he can be said to see in a weaker, phenomenal sense—he sees what isn't there—and this is to say just that he has visual experience.
18 syls
checking: (2) My analysandum is seeing in the intransitive sense, not seeing such-and-such particular thing.
error
checking: The latter analysandum poses all the problems of the former, and more besides: it raises the questions whether something is seen if it makes a suitable causal contribution to visual experience but it is not noticed separately from its background, and whether something is seen when part of it—for instance, its front surface—makes a causal contribution to visual experience.
error
checking: 7 IV My first stab is good enough to deal with some familiar counterexamples to causal analyses of seeing: they are not cases of seeing because they are not cases in which the scene before the eyes causes matching visual experience.
error
checking: 8 end p.276 Example 1: The Brain.
error
checking: I hallucinate at random; by chance I seem to see a brain floating before my eyes; my own brain happens to look just like the one I seem to see; my brain is causing my visual experience, which matches it.
18 syls
checking: I do not see.
4 syls
checking: No problem: my brain is no  part of the scene before my eyes.
15 syls
checking: Example 2: The Memory.
error
checking: I hallucinate not at random; visual memory influences the process; thus I seem to see again a scene from long ago; this past scene causes visual experience which matches it.
19 syls
checking: I do not see.
4 syls
checking: No problem: the past scene is not part of the scene before my eyes.
16 syls
checking: 9 However, more difficult cases are possible.
error
checking: They are cases of veridical hallucination, in which the scene before the eyes causes matching visual experience, and still one does not see.
error
checking: They show that what I have said so far does not provide a sufficient condition for seeing.
20 syls
checking: Example 3: The Brain Before the Eyes.
error
checking: As in Example 1, I hallucinate at random, I seem to see a brain before my eyes, my own brain looks just like the one I seem to see, and my brain is causing my visual experience.
error
checking: But this time my brain is before my eyes.
10 syls
checking: It has been carefully removed from my skull.
11 syls
checking: The nerves and blood vessels that connect it to the rest of me have been stretched somehow, not severed.
18 syls
checking: It is still working and still hallucinating.
12 syls
checking: Example 4: The Wizard.
error
checking: The scene before my eyes consists mostly of a wizard casting a spell.
18 syls
checking: His spell causes me to hallucinate at random, and the hallucination so caused happens to match the scene before my eyes.
20 syls
checking: Example 5: The Light Meter.
error
checking: I am blind; but electrodes have been implanted in my brain in such a way that when turned on they will end p.277 cause me to have visual experience of a certain sort of landscape.
18 syls
checking: A light meter is on my head.
8 syls
checking: It is connected to the electrodes in such a way that they are turned on if and only if the average illumination of the scene before my eyes exceeds a certain threshold.
18 syls
checking: By chance, just such a landscape is before my eyes, and its illumination is enough to turn on the electrodes.
19 syls
checking: V Ordinarily, when the scene before the eyes causes matching visual experience, it happens as follows.
20 syls
checking: Parts of the scene reflect or emit light in a certain pattern; this light travels to the eye by a more or less straight path, and is focused by the lens to form an image on the retina; the retinal cells are stimulated in proportion to the intensity and spectral distribution of the light that falls on them; these stimulated cells stimulate other cells in turn, and so on, and the stimulations comprise a signal which propagates up the optic nerve into the brain; and finally there is a pattern of stimulation in the brain cells which either is or else causes the subject's visual experience.
18 syls
checking: That is not at all what goes on in our three examples of veridical hallucination.
error
checking: Rather, the scene before the eyes causes matching visual experience by peculiar, non-standard causal processes.
19 syls
checking: Perhaps, as has been proposed by Grice10 and others, seeing requires the standard causal process.
error
checking: That would explain why Examples 3, 4, and 5 do not qualify as cases of seeing.
error
checking: (The proposal faces a technical dilemma.
13 syls
checking: If the standard process is defined as the process in which light is reflected or emitted, etc.
20 syls
checking: (as above), then it seems to follow that few of us now (and none in the not-too-distant past) know enough to have the concept of seeing; whereas if the standard process is defined as the most common process by which the scene before the eyes causes matching visual experience, whatever that may be, then it seems to follow that any of our examples of veridical hallucination might have been a case of seeing, and what I am doing now might not have been, if only the frequencies had been a bit different.
18 syls
checking: Either conclusion would be absurd.
9 syls
checking: However, the end p.278 dilemma can be avoided by appeal to the recent idea of fixing reference by rigidified descriptions.
error
checking: )11 Unfortunately, requiring the standard process would disqualify good cases along with the bad.
error
checking: Some cases in which the scene before the eyes causes matching visual experience by a nonstandard process seem fairly clearly to be cases of genuine seeing, not veridical hallucination.
18 syls
checking: Example 6: The Minority.
error
checking: It might be found that a few of us have visual systems that work on different principles from other people's.
18 syls
checking: The differences might be as extreme as the difference between AM versus FM transmission of signals; analogue versus digital processing; or point-by-point measurement of light versus edge detection.
18 syls
checking: If so, would we be prepared to say that the minority don't really see?
19 syls
checking: Would those who belong to the minority be prepared to say it?
17 syls
added: Would those who belong to the minority be prepared to say it?
checking: Surely not.
3 syls
checking: I anticipate the reply that the abnormal process in the minority is not different enough; the boundaries of the standard process should be drawn widely enough to include it.
21 syls
checking: But I think this puts the cart before the horse.
11 syls
checking: We know which processes to include just because somehow we already know which processes are ones by which someone might see.
18 syls
checking: Example 7: The Prosthetic Eye.
error
checking: A prosthetic eye consists of a miniature television camera mounted in, or on, the front of the head; a computer; and an array of electrodes in the brain.
20 syls
checking: The computer receives input from the camera and sends signals to the electrodes in such a way as to produce visual experience that matches the scene before the eyes.
18 syls
checking: When prosthetic eyes are perfected, the blind will see.
13 syls
checking: The standard process will be absent, unless by "standard process" we just mean one that permits seeing; but they will see by a nonstandard process.
18 syls
checking: Some prosthetic eyes are more convincing than others as means for genuine seeing.
19 syls
checking: (1) It seems better if the computer is surgically implanted rather than carried in a knapsack, but better if it's carried in a knapsack rather than stationary and linked by radio to the camera and electrodes.
error
checking: (2) It seems better if the prosthetic eye contains no end p.279 parts which can be regarded as having wills of their own and cooperating because they want to.
error
checking: (3) It seems better if the prosthetic eye works in some uniform way, rather than dealing with different sorts of inputs by significantly different means.
error
checking: (4) It seems better if it does not use processes which also figure in the standard processes by which we sometimes hallucinate.
error
checking: But if these considerations influence us, presumably it is because they make the prosthetic eye seem a little more like the natural eye.
18 syls
checking: (Or so we think—but we just might be wrong about the natural eye, and these properties of a prosthetic eye just might detract from the resemblance.
18 syls
checking: ) Why should that matter, once we grant that the standard process is not required?
19 syls
checking: I see no real need for any limits on how a prosthetic eye might work.
18 syls
checking: Even the least convincing cases of prosthetic vision are quite convincing enough.
20 syls
checking: If you insist that "strictly speaking" prosthetic vision isn't really seeing, then I'm prepared to concede you this much.
error
checking: Often we do leave semantic questions unsettled when we have no practical need to settle them.
20 syls
checking: Perhaps this is such a case, and you are resolving a genuine indeterminacy in the way you prefer.
error
checking: But if you are within your rights, so, I insist, am I. I do not really think my favoured usage is at all idiosyncratic.
19 syls
checking: But it scarcely matters: I would like to understand it whether it is idiosyncratic or not.
18 syls
checking: VI The trouble with veridical hallucination is not that it involves a non-standard causal process.
error
checking: Is it perhaps this: that the process involved produces matching visual experience only seldom, perhaps only this once?
19 syls
checking: No; someone might go on having veridical hallucinations for a long time.
error
checking: Veridical hallucinations are improbable, and a long run of them is still more improbable, but that doesn't make it impossible.
error
checking: No matter how long they go on, the sorts of occurrences I've classified as cases of veridical hallucination still are that and not seeing.
20 syls
checking: On the other hand, a process that permits genuine seeing might work only seldom, perhaps only this once.
18 syls
checking: Example 8: The Deathbed Cure.
error
checking: God might cure a blind man on his deathbed, granting him an instant of sight by means of some suitable non-standard process.
18 syls
checking: For an instant he sees  exactly as others do.
13 syls
checking: Then end p.280 he is dead.
error
checking: The scene before his eyes produces matching visual experience by a suitable process, but only this once.
18 syls
checking: Example 9: The Loose Wire.
error
checking: A prosthetic eye has a loose wire.
10 syls
checking: Mostly it flops around; and when it does the eye malfunctions and the subject's visual experience consists of splotches unrelated to the scene before the eyes.
19 syls
checking: But sometimes it touches the contact it ought to be bonded to; and as long as it does, the eye functions perfectly and the subject sees.
18 syls
checking: Whether he sees has nothing to do with whether the wire touches the contact often, or seldom, or only this once.
18 syls
checking: The proposal isn't far wrong.
error
checking: It asks almost the right question: when the scene before the eyes causes matching visual experience this time, is that an isolated case or is it part of a range of such cases?
19 syls
checking: The mistake is in asking for a range of actual cases, spread out in time.
18 syls
checking: Rather, we need a range of counterfactual alternatives to the case under consideration.
error
checking: VII What distinguishes our cases of veridical hallucination from genuine seeing—natural or prosthetic, lasting or momentary—is that there is no proper counterfactual dependence of visual experience on the scene before the eyes.
error
checking: If the scene had been different, it would not have caused correspondingly different visual experience to match that different scene.
18 syls
checking: Any match that occurs is a lucky accident.
13 syls
checking: It depends on the scene being just right.
10 syls
checking: In genuine seeing, the fact of match is independent of the scene.
18 syls
checking: Just as the actual scene causes matching visual experience, so likewise would alternative scenes.
18 syls
checking: Different scenes would have produced different visual experience, and thus the subject is in a position to discriminate between the alternatives.
18 syls
checking: This is my proposal: if the scene before the eyes causes matching visual experience as part of a suitable pattern of counterfactual dependence, then the subject sees; if the scene before the eyes causes matching visual experience without a suitable pattern of counterfactual dependence, then the subject does not see.
20 syls
checking: An ideal pattern of dependence would be one such that any scene whatever would produce perfectly matching visual experience.
20 syls
checking: But that is too much to require.
9 syls
checking: Certainly one can see even if the match, actual and counterfactual, is close but imperfect and the content of end p.281 visual experience is mostly, but not entirely, correct.
error
checking: Perhaps indeed this is our common lot.
11 syls
checking: Further, one can see even if there are some alternative scenes that would fail altogether to produce matching visual experience, so long as the actual scene is not one of those ones.
18 syls
checking: Example 10: The Laser Beam.
error
checking: I see now; but if the scene before my eyes had included a powerful laser beam straight into my eyes, I would have been instantly struck blind and would not have had matching visual experience even for a moment.
19 syls
checking: Example 11: The Hypnotic Suggestion.
error
checking: I must do business with Martians and I can't stand the sight of them.
17 syls
added: I must do business with Martians and I can't stand the sight of them.
checking: The remedy is hypnotic suggestion: when a Martian is before my eyes I will seem to see not a Martian but a nice black cat.
18 syls
checking: Thus when there are Martians around, the scene before my eyes causes visual experience that does not match the scene very closely.
19 syls
checking: But when there are no Martians, I see perfectly well.
13 syls
checking: 12 We cannot require that any two different scenes would produce different visual experience; for they might differ in some invisible respect, in which case the same visual experience would match both equally well.
error
checking: Its content would concern only those aspects of the scene in which both are alike.
18 syls
checking: For one who sees, visibly different scenes would (for the most part) produce different visual experience; but that is unhelpful unless we say which differences are the visible ones, and that seems to be an empirical matter rather than part of the analysis of seeing.
18 syls
checking: What can be required analytically is that there be plenty of visible differences of some sort or other; that is, plenty of  different alternative scenes that would produce different visual experience and thus be visually discriminable.
18 syls
checking: That would almost follow from a requirement of match over a wide range of alternative scenes.
18 syls
checking: But not quite.
3 syls
checking: Most of our visual experience is rich in content; but some is poor in content and would match a wide range of alternative scenes equally well.
18 syls
checking: Any pitch-dark scene would produce matching visual experience—what content there is would be entirely correct—but it would be the same in every case.
18 syls
checking: Seeing end p.282 is a capacity to discriminate, so this sort of match over a wide range of alternatives will not suffice.
error
checking: I conclude that the required pattern of counterfactual dependence may be specified as follows.
error
checking: There is a large class of alternative possible scenes before the subject's eyes, and there are many mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive subclasses thereof, such that (1) any scene in the large class would cause visual experience closely matching that scene, and (2) any two scenes in different subclasses would cause different visual experience.
19 syls
checking: The requirement admits of degree in three ways.
12 syls
checking: How large a class?
4 syls
checking: How many subclasses?
error
checking: How close a match?
4 syls
checking: The difference between veridical hallucination and genuine seeing is not sharp, on my analysis.
error
checking: It is fuzzy; when the requirement of suitable counterfactual dependence is met to some degree, but to a degree that falls short of the standard set by normal seeing, we may expect borderline cases.
error
checking: And indeed it is easy to imagine cases of partial blindness, or of rudimentary prosthetic vision, in which the counterfactual dependence is unsatisfactory and it is therefore doubtful whether the subject may be said to see.
18 syls
checking: VIII A further condition might also be imposed: that in the actual case the subject's visual experience must be rich in content, that it must not be the sort of visual experience that would match a wide range of scenes equally well.
error
checking: For instance, it must not be the sort of visual experience that we have when it is pitch dark.
18 syls
checking: This condition of rich content is needed to explain why we do not see in the dark, even though the scene before the eyes causes matching visual experience as part of a suitable pattern of counterfactual dependence.
18 syls
checking: But we are of two minds on the matter.
10 syls
checking: We think we do not see in the dark; but also we think we find things out by sight only when we see; and in the pitch dark, we find out by sight that it is dark.
18 syls
checking: How else—by smell?
4 syls
checking: By the very fact that we do not see?
10 syls
checking: —No, for we also do not see in dazzling light or thick fog, and it is by sight that we distinguish various situations in which we do not see.
18 syls
checking: In a sense, we do see in the dark when we see that it is dark.
16 syls
processed: 5500
checking: In a more common sense, we never see in the dark.
13 syls
checking: There is an ambiguity in our concept of seeing, and the condition of rich content is often but not always required.
18 syls
checking: When it is, it admits of degree and thus permits still another sort of borderline case of seeing.
18 syls
checking: end p.283 IX Given a suitable pattern of counterfactual dependence of visual experience on the scene before the eyes (including both the actual case and its counterfactual alternatives) it is redundant to say as I did that the scene causes, or would cause, the visual experience.
error
checking: To make the explicit mention of causation redundant, according to my counterfactual analysis of causation, we need not only a suitable battery of scene-to-visual-experience counterfactuals but also some further counterfactuals.
18 syls
checking: Along with each counterfactual saying that if the scene were S the visual experience would be E, we need another saying that if the scene S were entirely absent, the visual experience would not be E. Counterfactuals of the latter sort may follow from the battery of sceneto-visual-experience counterfactuals in some cases, but they do not do so generally.
error
checking: According to  the counterfactual analysis of causation that I have defended elsewhere,13 any such counterfactual dependence among distinct occurrences is causal dependence, and implies causation of the dependent occurrences by those on which they depend.
error
checking: It would suffice if our counterfactuals said just that if the scene before the eyes were so-and-so, then the visual experience would be such-andsuch.
error
checking: If we leave the causation implicit, however, then we must take care that the counterfactuals from scene to visual experience are of the proper sort to comprise a causal dependence.
18 syls
checking: We must avoid backtrackers: those counterfactuals that we would support by arguing that different effects would have to have been produced by different causes.
error
checking: 14 Backtracking counterfactual dependence does not imply causal dependence and does not suffice for seeing.
error
checking: Example 12: The Screen.
error
checking: I am hallucinating at random.
10 syls
checking: My hallucinations at any moment are determined by my precursor brain states a few seconds before.
20 syls
checking: My brain states are monitored, and my hallucinations are predicted by a fast computer.
18 syls
checking: It controls a battery of lights focused on a screen before my eyes in such a way that the scene before my eyes end p.284 is made to match my predicted visual experience at the time.
18 syls
checking: It is true in a sense—in the backtracking sense—that whatever might be on the screen, my visual experience would match it.
18 syls
checking: But my visual experience does not depend causally on the scene before my eyes.
error
checking: Rather, they are independent effects of a common cause, namely my precursor brain states.
18 syls
checking: Therefore I do not see.
6 syls
checking: The same example shows that it would not suffice just to require that the laws of nature and the prevailing conditions imply a suitable correspondence between visual experience and the scene before the eyes.
18 syls
checking: That could be so without the proper sort of counterfactual, and hence causal, dependence; in which case one would not see.
error
checking: X The following case (Example 11 carried to extremes) is a hard one.
error
checking: It closely resembles cases of genuine seeing, and we might well be tempted to classify it as such.
18 syls
checking: According to my analysis, however, it is a case of veridical hallucination.
error
checking: The scene before the eyes causes matching visual experience without any pattern of counterfactual dependence whatever, suitable or otherwise.
19 syls
checking: Example 13: The Censor.
error
checking: My natural or prosthetic eye is in perfect condition and functioning normally, and by means of it the scene before my eyes causes matching visual experience.
20 syls
checking: But if the scene were any different my visual experience would be just the same.
18 syls
checking: For there is a censor standing by, ready to see to it that I have precisely that visual experience and no other, whatever the scene may be.
18 syls
checking: (Perhaps the censor is external, perhaps it is something in my own brain.
18 syls
checking: ) So long as the scene is such as to cause the right experience, the censor does nothing.
19 syls
checking: But if the scene were any different, the censor would intervene and cause the same experience by other means.
18 syls
checking: If so, my eye would not function normally and the scene before my eyes would not cause matching visual experience.
18 syls
checking: The case is one of causal preemption.
10 syls
checking: 15 The scene before my eyes is the actual cause of my visual experience: the censor is an alternative potential cause of the same effect.
error
checking: The actual cause preempts the potential end p.285 cause, stopping the alternative causal chain that would otherwise have gone to completion.
error
checking: The argument for classifying the case as seeing is that it is just like a clear case of seeing except for the presence of the censor; and, after all, the censor doesn't actually do anything; and if the scene before the eyes were different and the censor nevertheless stood idly by—as in actuality— then the different scene would indeed cause suitably different visual experience.
18 syls
checking: My reply is that the case is really not so very much like the clear case of seeing to which it is compared.
18 syls
checking: The censor's idleness is an essential factor in the causal process by which matching visual experience is produced, just as the censor's intervention would be in the alternative process.
18 syls
checking: No such factor is present in the comparison case.
14 syls
checking: If the scene were different this factor would not be there, so it is wrong to hold it fixed in asking what would happen if the scene were different.
18 syls
checking: We cannot uniformly ignore or hold fixed those causal factors which are absences of interventions.
18 syls
checking: The standard process might be riddled with them.
11 syls
checking: (Think of a circuit built up from exclusive-or-gates: every output signal from such a gate is caused partly by the absence of a second input signal.
18 syls
checking: ) Who knows what would happen in an ordinary case of natural (or prosthetic) vision if the scene were different and all absences of interventions were held fixed?
18 syls
checking: Who cares?
2 syls
checking: We do not in general hold fixed the absences of intervention, and I see no good reason to give the censor's idleness special treatment.
18 syls
checking: The decisive consideration, despite the misleading resemblance of this case to genuine cases of seeing, is that the censor's potential victim has no capacity at all to discriminate by sight.
18 syls
checking: Just as in any other case of veridical hallucination, the match that occurs is a lucky accident.
error
checking: 16 end p.286 Postscript to "Veridical Hallucination and Prosthetic Vision" Further Considerations on "Suitability" As I noted, it is in several ways a matter of degree whether my condition for "a suitable pattern of counterfactual dependence" is satisfied.
error
checking: That leaves room for borderline cases of seeing.
12 syls
checking: Among these borderline cases, some may be better than others.
16 syls
checking: I think there are further considerations that never—or hardly ever—make the difference between a clear negative case and a clear positive, but that do influence our judgments that one unclear case is more of a case of seeing than another.
19 syls
checking: The general principle is simple: we know what happens in the ideal or normal case, and differences from that tend to detract from the claim of other cases to be judged positive.
19 syls
checking: It is in this way, if at all, that considerations of mechanism are relevant.
19 syls
checking: I do not think they are ever decisive, or close to decisive, by themselves.
18 syls
checking: But they may tend to incline us one way or another in otherwise doubtful cases.
18 syls
checking: A second consideration that might have some weight, but I think much less than decisive weight, comes if we have a probabilistic kind of causal dependence.
18 syls
checking: (See Postscript D to "Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow," Postscript C to "Causation," and "Causal Decision Theory," all in this volume.
error
checking: ) Suppose that what we have are not counterfactuals saying that if there were such-and-such scene then there would definitely be such-and-such matching experience; but rather that there would be a chance distribution over experiences giving significant probability (and much more than there would have been without the scene) to matching experience.
error
checking: Other things being equal, the better the chances of matching experience, the better case of seeing.
20 syls
checking: Here I have in mind the actual chance given the actual scene, as well as the chances there would be given other scenes.
18 syls
checking: Ex hypothesi the actual experience does match the actual scene.
error
checking: And that is enough, if I am right that a counterfactual with a true antecedent is true iff its consequent end p.287 is, to give us a non-probabilistic counterfactual for that one, actual scene: if there were that scene, there would be that matching experience.
error
checking: But there will be a probabilistic counterfactual as well: if there were that scene, there would be so-and-so chance of that matching experience, and maybe also some chance of various other experiences.
error
checking: If the actual chance of match is substantially below one, then despite the non-probabilistic counterfactual, we have a consideration that detracts somewhat from the claim of the case to be judged positive.
19 syls
checking: John Bigelow has suggested (in discussion, 1980) a third consideration: call it the Island Effect.
error
checking: There are good scenes that would produce matching experience, and bad scenes that would not.
18 syls
checking: An ideal pattern would have no bad scenes, but that is too much to demand; so I settled for the requirement that there be a wide range of good scenes.
18 syls
checking: Note that scenes may be close together or far apart; they may differ from one another more or less.
18 syls
checking: So a good scene might be surrounded by other good scenes, with no bad ones nearby.
18 syls
checking: The nearest bad scene to it might differ quite substantially.
15 syls
checking: Or at the opposite extreme it might be a tiny island, surrounded by a sea of bad scenes.
19 syls
checking: Suppose the  actual good scene is such an island.
13 syls
checking: My requirement that there be a wide range of good scenes may be satisfied only in virtue of some distant continent.
18 syls
checking: (Or in virtue of many other islands, widely scattered.
15 syls
checking: ) It's a narrow escape: the subject sees, on my analysis, but had the scene been just a little different then he wouldn't have done.
18 syls
checking: For any scene just a little different would have been a bad scene.
17 syls
added: For any scene just a little different would have been a bad scene.
checking: To make matters still worse, Bigelow considers the case that any nearby scene not only would have been bad, but also would have produced just the same experience that the actual good scene produces.
19 syls
checking: Within limits—the distance to the next land—a different scene would have made no difference to visual experience.
18 syls
checking: Then does the subject see?
6 syls
checking: One might go so far as to think that extreme cases of the Island Effect are clear cases of not seeing, even if there is nothing else wrong with them.
19 syls
checking: I disagree; but I certainly think that the Island Effect influences comparative judgements about unclear cases, even that it suffices to turn what would otherwise be clearly positive cases into doubtful ones.
20 syls
checking: I said that these secondary considerations would never turn a clear positive into a clear negative—or hardly ever.
18 syls
checking: What if all three of the secondary considerations were present to an extreme degree, working together?
18 syls
checking: What if there is an abnormal mechanism; and in addition the chance of matching experience given the actual scene is quite low, end p.288 though as it happens there is matching experience; and in addition the actual scene is a tiny island, and my requirement of counterfactual dependence through a wide range of scenes is satisfied only by means of scenes quite different from the actual one?
18 syls
checking: How would we judge that case?
6 syls
checking: It satisfies my main conditions; but the secondary considerations go against it as powerfully as can be.
20 syls
checking: I know how I did judge such a case: I judged it negative.
15 syls
checking: And so perhaps did you, if you read my paper before reading this postscript.
19 syls
checking: For it is none other than my example of the wizard.
15 syls
checking: I thought it a clear negative case, and cited it in my favor, without ever noticing that my own conditions classified it as positive!
19 syls
checking: 1 For the actual scene with the hallucinogenic wizard does cause matching experience;2 and we do have a wide range of alternative scenes—namely, ordinary scenes without the wizard—that would cause matching experience in a normal way.
error
checking: (Compare scenes without Martians in my example of the hypnotic suggestion.
20 syls
checking: ) So the secondary considerations can have decisive weight, if they all push together as hard as they can.
18 syls
checking: Nothing less would do, I think.
7 syls
checking: I would not judge the example of the wizard negative if the spell left the normal mechanism in operation but increased its rate of random errors and thus drastically lowered its probability of success; or if the wizard's presence produced matching experience for that particular scene with high probability, though not by the standard mechanism; or if the scene with the wizard were in the midst of other scenes that would somehow, with significant probability, also produce matching experience.
18 syls
checking: Bruce LeCatt3 has suggested a consideration that tends in the positive direction: Stepwise Dependence.
error
checking: Take some intermediate stage in the causal process that leads from scene to visual experience.
18 syls
checking: It may be that there is a good pattern of counterfactual dependence whereby what goes on at the intermediate stage depends on the scene; and also a end p.289 good pattern of counterfactual dependence whereby visual experience depends on what goes on at the intermediate stage.
error
checking: Further, this two-fold pattern might link scenes indirectly with matching experience, over a suitably wide and varied range of scenes.
21 syls
checking: Even more indirectly, there might be linkage via a threefold pattern of counterfactual dependence involving two intermediate stages; and so on.
19 syls
checking: Then we have a suitable pattern of stepwise counterfactual dependence of visual experience on the scene before the eyes.
error
checking: It does not follow that we have a suitable pattern of counterfactual dependence simpliciter, because counterfactuals are not necessarily transitive.
error
checking: 4 In fact my case of the censor is a case of excellent stepwise dependence and no dependence simpliciter at all.
error
checking: LeCatt suggests, and I agree, that it is the stepwise dependence that accounts for any inclinations we have to judge the case of the censor as a positive case of seeing.
error
checking: He further claims that this judgment is correct; but there I do not agree, and I insist that the essential feature of seeing is altogether missing.
18 syls
checking: But there are mixed cases: partial or conditional censorship, some dependence simpliciter but not much compared with normal cases.
20 syls
checking: Then indeed the presence of stepwise dependence might make the difference between better cases and worse.
error
checking: end p.290 Twenty-Five Are We Free to Break the Laws?
error
checking: Soft determinism seems to have an incredible consequence.
17 syls
added: Soft determinism seems to have an incredible consequence.
checking: It seems to imply, given certain acceptable further premises, that sometimes we are able to act in such a way that the laws of nature are broken.
18 syls
checking: But if we distinguish a strong and a weak version of this incredible consequence, I think we shall find that it is the strong version that is incredible and the weak version that is the consequence.
19 syls
checking: Soft determinism is the doctrine that sometimes one freely does what one is predetermined to do; and that in such a case one is able to act otherwise though past history and the laws of nature determine that one will not act otherwise.
18 syls
checking: Compatibilism is the doctrine that soft determinism may be true.
error
checking: A compatibilist might well doubt soft determinism because he doubts on physical grounds that we are ever predetermined to act as we do, or perhaps because he doubts on psychoanalytic grounds that we ever act freely.
error
checking: I myself am a compatibilist but no determinist, hence I am obliged to rebut some objections against soft determinism but not others.
error
checking: But for the sake of the argument, let me feign to uphold soft determinism, and indeed a particular instance thereof.
21 syls
checking: I have just put my hand down on my desk.
10 syls
checking: That, let me claim, was a free but predetermined act.
13 syls
checking: I was able to act otherwise, for instance to raise my hand, But there is a true historical proposition H about the intrinsic state of the world long ago, and there is a true proposition L end p.291 specifying the laws of nature that govern our world, such that H and L jointly determine what I did.
18 syls
checking: They jointly imply the proposition that I put my hand down.
16 syls
checking: They jointly contradict the proposition that I raised my hand.
16 syls
checking: Yet I was free; I was able to raise my hand.
12 syls
checking: The way in which I was determined not to was not the sort of way that counts as inability.
18 syls
checking: What if I had raised my hand?
7 syls
checking: Then at least one of three things would have been true.
11 syls
checking: Contradictions would have been true together; or the historical proposition H would not have been true; or the law proposition L would not have been true.
21 syls
checking: Which?
1 syls
checking: Here we need auxiliary premises; but since I accept the premises my opponent requires to make his case, we may proceed.
19 syls
checking: Of our three alternatives, we may dismiss the first; for if I had raised my hand, there would still have been no true contradictions.
18 syls
checking: Likewise we may dismiss the second; for if I had raised my hand, the intrinsic state of the world long ago would have been no different.
20 syls
checking: 1 That leaves the third alternative.
error
checking: If I had raised my hand, the law proposition L would not have been true.
18 syls
checking: That follows by a principle of the logic of counterfactuals which is almost uncontroversial:2 A □→ B v C v D, A □→ - B, A □→ - C, ∴A □→ D. If L had not been true, that implies that some law of nature would have been broken, for L is a specification of the laws.
error
checking: That is not to say that anything would have been both a law and broken—that is a contradiction in terms if, as I suppose, any genuine law is at least an absolutely unbroken regularity.
18 syls
checking: Rather, if L had not been true, something that is in fact a law, and unbroken, would have been broken, and no law.
20 syls
checking: It would at best have been an almost-law.
10 syls
checking: In short, as a (feigned) soft determinist, who accepts the requisite auxiliary premises and principle of counterfactual logic, I am committed to the consequence that if I had done what I was able to do—raise my hand—then some law would have been broken.
21 syls
checking: "That is to say," my opponent paraphrases, "you claim to be able to break the very laws of nature.
error
checking: And with so little effort!
7 syls
checking: A marvelous power indeed!
8 syls
checking: Can you also bend spoons"?
6 syls
checking: Distinguo.
error
checking: My opponent's paraphrase is not quite right.
12 syls
checking: He has replaced the weak thesis that I accept with a stronger thesis that I join him in rejecting.
18 syls
checking: The strong thesis is utterly incredible, but it is no part end p.292  of soft determinism.
18 syls
checking: The weak thesis is controversial, to be sure, but a soft determinist should not mind being committed to it.
19 syls
checking: The two theses are as follows.
8 syls
checking: (Weak Thesis) I am able to do something such that, if I did it, a law would be broken.
18 syls
checking: (Strong Thesis) I am able to break a law.
11 syls
checking: To see the difference, consider not a marvelous ability to break a law but a commonplace ability to break a window.
18 syls
checking: Perhaps I am able to throw a stone in a certain direction; and perhaps if I did, the stone would hit a certain window and the window would break.
18 syls
checking: Then I am able to break a window.
10 syls
checking: For starters: I am able to do something such that, if I did it, a window would be broken.
18 syls
checking: But there is more to be said.
7 syls
checking: I am able to do something such that, if I did it, my act would cause a window-breaking event.
18 syls
checking: Or consider a commonplace ability to break a promise.
17 syls
added: Or consider a commonplace ability to break a promise.
checking: Perhaps I am able to throw a stone; and perhaps if I did, I would break my promise never to throw a stone.
18 syls
checking: Then I am able to break a promise.
10 syls
checking: For starters: I am able to do something such that, if I did it, a promise would be broken.
18 syls
checking: But there is more to be said.
7 syls
added:  Then I am able to break a promise. But there is more to be said.
checking: I am able to do something such that, if I did it, my act would itself be a promise-breaking event.
19 syls
checking: Next, consider what really would be a marvelous ability to break a law—an ability I could not credibly claim.
18 syls
checking: Suppose that I were able to throw a stone very, very hard.
16 syls
checking: And suppose that if I did, the stone would fly faster than light, an event contrary to law.
18 syls
checking: Then I really would be able to break a law.
12 syls
checking: For starters: I would be able to do something such that, if I did it, a law would be broken.
18 syls
checking: But there is more to be said.
7 syls
checking: I would be able to do something such that, if I did it, my act would cause a law-breaking event.
18 syls
checking: Or suppose that I were able to throw a stone so hard that in the course of the throw my own hand would move faster than light.
18 syls
checking: Then again I would be able to break a law, regardless of what my act might cause.
18 syls
checking: For starters: I would be able to do something such that, if I did it, a law would be broken.
18 syls
checking: But there is more to be said.
7 syls
checking: I would be able to do something such that, if I did it, my act would itself be a law-breaking event.
18 syls
checking: If no act of mine either caused or was a window-, promise-, or law-breaking event, then I think it could not be true that I broke a window, a promise, or a law.
19 syls
checking: Therefore I am able to break a window, a promise, or a law only if I am able to do something such that, if I did it, my act end p.293 either would cause or would be a window-, promise-, or law-breaking event.
19 syls
checking: Maybe my opponent will contend that according to soft determinism, there is another way of being able to break a law.
20 syls
checking: But I see no reason to grant his contention.
12 syls
checking: Now consider the disputed case.
9 syls
checking: I am able to raise my hand, although it is predetermined that I will not.
18 syls
checking: If I raised my hand, some law would be broken.
11 syls
checking: I even grant that a law-breaking event would take place.
14 syls
checking: (Here I use the present tense neutrally.
10 syls
checking: I mean to imply nothing about when a law-breaking event would take place.
18 syls
checking: ) But is it so that my act of raising my hand would cause any law-breaking event?
19 syls
checking: Is it so that my act of raising my hand would itself be a law-breaking event?
19 syls
checking: Is it so that any other act of mine would cause or would be a law-breaking event?
18 syls
checking: If not, then my ability to raise my hand confers no marvelous ability to break a law, even though a law would be broken if I did it.
18 syls
checking: 3 Had I raised my hand, a law would have been broken beforehand.
error
checking: The course of events would have diverged from the actual course of events a little while before I raised my hand, and at the point of divergence there would have been a law-breaking event—a divergence miracle, as I have called it ([4]).
18 syls
checking: But this divergence miracle would not have been caused by my raising my hand.
18 syls
checking: If anything, the causation would have been the other way around.
17 syls
added: If anything, the causation would have been the other way around.
checking: Nor would the divergence miracle have been my act of raising my hand.
18 syls
checking: That act was altogether absent from the actual course of events, so it cannot get under way until there is already some divergence.
18 syls
checking: Nor would it have been caused by any other act of mine, earlier or later.
18 syls
checking: Nor would it have been any other act of mine.
12 syls
checking: Nor is there any reason to say that if I had raised my hand there would have been some other lawbreaking event besides the end p.294  divergence miracle; still less, that some other law-breaking event would have been caused by, or would have been, my act of raising my hand.
18 syls
checking: To accommodate my hypothetical raising of my hand while holding fixed all that can and should be held fixed, it is necessary to suppose one divergence miracle, gratuitous to suppose any further law-breaking.
19 syls
checking: Thus I insist that I was able to raise my hand, and I acknowledge that a law would have been broken had I done so, but I deny that I am therefore able to break a law.
18 syls
checking: To uphold my instance of soft determinism, I need not claim any incredible powers.
19 syls
checking: To uphold the compatibilism that I actually believe, I need not claim that such powers are even possible.
error
checking: I said that if I had raised my hand, the divergence miracle beforehand would not have been caused by my raising my hand.
19 syls
checking: That seems right.
3 syls
checking: But my opponent might argue ad hominem that according to my own analysis of causation ([3]), my raising my hand does turn out to cause the divergence miracle.
18 syls
checking: The effect would precede the cause, but I do not object to that.
16 syls
checking: We seem to have the right pattern of counterfactual dependence between distinct events: (1) if I had raised my hand, the divergence miracle would have occurred, but (2) if I had not raised my hand, it would not have occurred.
error
checking: I reply that we do not have this required pattern, nor would we have had it if I had raised my hand.
18 syls
checking: Therefore I am safe in denying that the miracle would have been caused by my act.
18 syls
checking: We do not have the pattern because (1) is false.
error
checking: What is true is only that if I had raised my hand, then some or other divergence miracle would have occurred.
18 syls
checking: There is no particular divergence miracle that definitely would have occurred, since the divergence might have happened in various ways.
18 syls
checking: 4 If I had raised my hand, (1) would have been true.
error
checking: But we still would not have had the right pattern, because in that case (2) would have been false.
error
checking: Consider a counterfactual situation in which a divergence miracle beforehand has allowed me to raise my hand.
error
checking: Is it so, from the stand-point of that situation, that if I had not raised my hand, the miracle end p.295 would not have taken place?
18 syls
checking: No; the miracle might have taken place, only to have its work undone straightway by a second miracle.
18 syls
checking: (Even in this doubly counterfactual context, when I speak of a miracle I mean a violation of the actual laws.
error
checking: ) What is true, at most, is that if I had not raised my hand, then the first miracle might not have taken place.
20 syls
checking: My incompatibilist opponent is a creature of fiction, but he has his prototypes in real life.
error
checking: He is modelled partly on Peter van Inwagen ([5], [6], [7]) and partly on myself when I first worried about van Inwagen's argument against compatibilism.
error
checking: He definitely is not van Inwagen; he does not choose his words so carefully.
error
checking: Still I think that for all his care, van Inwagen is in the same boat with my fictitious opponent.
error
checking: Van Inwagen's argument runs as follows, near enough.
error
checking: (I recast it as a reductio against the instance of soft determinism that I feign to uphold.
error
checking: ) I did not raise my hand; suppose for reductio that I could have raised my hand, although determinism is true.
error
checking: Then it follows, given four premises that I cannot question, that I could have rendered false the conjunction HL of a certain historical proposition H about the state of the world before my birth and a certain law proposition L. If so, then I could have rendered L false.
18 syls
checking: (Premise 5.
error
checking: ) But I could not have rendered L false.
9 syls
checking: (Premise 6.
error
checking: ) This refutes our supposition.
9 syls
checking: To this I reply that Premise 5 and Premise 6 are not both true.
error
checking: Which one is true depends on what van Inwagen means by "could have rendered false".
error
checking: It does not matter what "could have rendered false" means in ordinary language; van Inwagen introduced the phrase as a term of art.
19 syls
checking: It does not even matter what meaning van Inwagen gave it.
error
checking: What matters is whether we can give it any meaning that would meet his needs—any meaning that would make all his premises defensible without circularity.
18 syls
checking: I shall consider two meanings.
8 syls
checking: I think there is nothing in van Inwagen's text to suggest any third meaning that might work better than these two.
error
checking: 5 end p.296  First, a preliminary definition.
error
checking: Let us say that an event would falsify a proposition iff, necessarily, if that event occurs then that proposition is false.
error
checking: For instance, an event consisting of a stone's flying faster than light would falsify a law.
18 syls
checking: So would an act of throwing in which my hand moves faster than light.
16 syls
checking: So would a divergence miracle.
9 syls
checking: But my act of throwing a stone would not itself falsify the proposition that the window in the line of fire remains intact; all that is true is that my act would cause another event that would falsify that proposition.
20 syls
checking: My act of raising my hand would falsify any sufficiently inclusive conjunction of history and law.
20 syls
checking: But it would not itself falsify any law—not if all the requisite law-breaking were over and done with beforehand.
19 syls
checking: All that is true is that my act would be preceded by another event—the divergence miracle—that would falsify a law.
19 syls
checking: Let us say that I could have rendered a proposition false in the weak sense iff I was able to do something such that, if I did it, the proposition would have been falsified (though not necessarily by my act, or by any event caused by my act).
18 syls
checking: And let us say that I could have rendered a proposition false in the strong sense iff I was able to do something such that, if I did it, the proposition would have been falsified either by my act itself or by some event caused by my act.
18 syls
checking: The Weak Thesis, which as a soft determinist I accept, is the thesis that I could have rendered a law false in the weak sense.
19 syls
checking: The Strong Thesis, which I reject, is the thesis that I could have rendered a law false in the strong sense.
18 syls
checking: The first part of van Inwagen's argument succeeds whichever sense we take.
error
checking: If I could have raised my hand despite the fact that determinism is true and I did not raise it, then indeed it is true both in the weak sense and in the strong sense that I could have rendered false the conjunction HL of history and law.
18 syls
checking: But I could have rendered false the law proposition L in the weak sense, though I could not have rendered L false in the strong sense.
18 syls
checking: So if we take the weak sense throughout the argument, then I deny Premise 6.
19 syls
checking: If instead we take the strong sense, then I deny Premise 5.
error
checking: Van Inwagen supports both premises by considering analogous cases.
error
checking: I think the supporting arguments fail because the cases produced are not analogous: they are cases in which the weak and strong senses do not diverge.
18 syls
checking: In support of Premise 6, he invites us to reject the supposition that a physicist could render a law false by building and operating a machine that would accelerate protons to twice the speed of light.
error
checking: Reject that supposition by all means; but that does nothing to support Premise 6 taken in the weak sense, for the rejected supposition end p.297 is that the physicist could render a law false in the strong sense.
18 syls
checking: In support of Premise 5, he invites us to reject the supposition that a traveler could render false a conjunction of a historical proposition and a proposition about his future travels otherwise than by rendering false the nonhistorical conjunct.
error
checking: Reject that supposition by all means, but that does nothing to support Premise 5 taken in the strong sense.
18 syls
checking: Given that one could render false, in the strong sense, a conjunction of historical and nonhistorical propositions (and given that, as in the cases under consideration, there is no question of rendering the historical conjunct false by means of time travel or the like), what follows?
21 syls
checking: Does it follow that one could render the nonhistorical conjunct false in the strong sense?
error
checking: That is what would support Premise 5 in the strong sense.
error
checking: Or does it only follow, as I think, that one could render the nonhistorical conjunct false in at least the weak sense?
error
checking: The case of the traveler is useless in answering that question, since if the traveler could render the proposition about his future travels false in the weak sense, he could also render it false in the strong sense.

checking: Prisoners' Dilemma is a Newcomb Problem—or rather, two Newcomb Problems side by side, one per prisoner.
18 syls
checking: Only the inessential trappings are different.
error
checking: Let us make them the same.
6 syls
checking: You and I, the "prisoners," are separated.
12 syls
checking: Each is offered the choice: to rat or not to rat.
12 syls
checking: (The action of "ratting" is so called because I consider it to be rational—but that is controversial.
error
checking: ) Ratting is done as follows: one reaches out and takes a transparent box, which is seen to contain a thousand dollars.
error
checking: A prisoner who rats gets to keep the thousand.
12 syls
checking: (Maybe ratting is construed as an act of confessing and accusing one's partner, much as taking the Queen's shilling was once end p.299 construed as an act of enlisting—but that is irrelevant to the decision problem.
error
checking: ) If either prisoner declines to rat, he is not at all rewarded, but his partner is presented with a million dollars, nicely packed in an opaque box.
18 syls
checking: (Maybe each faces a long sentence and a short sentence to be served consecutively; escape from the long sentence costs a million, and escape from the short sentence costs a thousand.
22 syls
checking: But it is irrelevant how the prisoners propose to spend their money.
19 syls
checking: ) So the payoff matrix looks like this.
9 syls
checking: I rat I don't rat You rat I get $1,000 I get $0 You get $1,000 You get $1,001,000 You don't rat I get $1,001,000 I get $1,000,000 You get $0 You get $1,000,000 There we have it: a perfectly typical case of Prisoners' Dilemma.
error
checking: My decision problem, in a nutshell, is as follows; yours is exactly similar.
19 syls
checking: (1) I am offered a thousand—take it or leave it.
error
checking: (2) Perhaps also I will be given a million; but whether I will or not is causally independent of what I do now.
error
checking: Nothing I can do now will have any effect on whether or not I get my million.
18 syls
checking: (3) I will get my million if and only if you do not take your thousand.
error
checking: Newcomb's Problem is the same as regards points (1) and (2).
error
checking: The only difference—if such it be—is that point (3) is replaced by (3′) I will get my million if and only if it is predicted that I do not take my thousand.
error
checking: "Predicted" need not mean "predicted in advance".
12 syls
checking: Not so in English: we credit new theories with success in "predicting" phenomena already observed.
18 syls
checking: And not so in Newcomb's Problem.
9 syls
checking: While it dramatizes the problem to think of the million already there, or else already not there, in the opaque box in front of me as I deliberate, it is agreed all around that what really matters is (2), and hence that the "prediction" end p.300 should be causally independent of my decision.
18 syls
checking: Making the prediction ahead of time is one good way to secure this causal independence.
18 syls
checking: But it is not the only way.
8 syls
checking: 2 Provided that I can have no effect on it, the prediction could just as well be made simultaneously with my decision or even afterwards, and the character of Newcomb's Problem would be unchanged.
error
checking: 3 Likewise in the case of Prisoners' Dilemma nothing need be assumed—and in my telling of the story, nothing was assumed—about whether the prisoners are put to the test simultaneously or one after the other.
error
checking: Also it is inessential to Newcomb's Problem that any prediction—in advance, or otherwise—should actually take place.
error
checking: It is enough that some potentially predictive process should go on, and that whether I get my million is somehow made to depend on the outcome of that  process.
18 syls
checking: It could all be automated: if the predictive computer sends a pulse of current to the moneyputting machine I get my million, otherwise not.
18 syls
checking: Or there might be people who put the million in the box or not depending on the outcome of the process, but who do not at all think of the outcome as a prediction of my choice, or as warrant for a prediction.
19 syls
checking: It makes no difference to my decision problem whether someone—the one who gives the million, or perhaps some by-stander—does or doesn't form beliefs about what I will do by inference from the outcome of the predictive process.
18 syls
checking: Eliminating inessentials, then, Newcomb's Problem is characterized by (1), (2), and (3″) I will get my million if and only if a certain potentially predictive process (which may go on before, during, or after my choice) yields the outcome which could warrant a prediction that I do not take my thousand.
error
checking: The potentially predictive process par excellence is simulation.
19 syls
checking: To predict whether I will take my thousand, make a replica of me, put my replica in a replica of my predicament, and see whether my replica takes his thousand.
18 syls
checking: And whether or not anybody actually makes a prediction about me by observing my replica, still my replica's decision is a potentially predictive process with respect to mine.
18 syls
checking: Disregarding predictive processes other than simulation, if such there be, we have this special case of (3″): end p.301 (3'") I will get my million if and only if my replica does not take his thousand.
18 syls
checking: There are replicas and replicas.
9 syls
added:  But it is not the only way. There are replicas and replicas.
checking: Some are the same sort of thing that I am, others are less so.
15 syls
checking: A flesh-and-blood duplicate made by copying me atom for atom would be one good sort of replica.
18 syls
checking: A working scale model of me, smaller perhaps by a ratio of 1:148, also might serve.
18 syls
checking: So might a pattern of bits in a computer, or beads on an abacus, or marks on paper, or neuron firings in a brain, even though these things are unlike me and replicate me only by way of some complicated isomorphism.
19 syls
checking: Also, some replicas are more reliable than others.
15 syls
checking: There may be grounds for greater or lesser degrees of confidence that my replica and I will decide alike in the matter of the thousand.
18 syls
checking: A replica that matches me perfectly in the respects relevant to my decision (whether duplicate or isomorph) will have more predictive power than a less perfect replica; but even a poor replica may have some significant degree of predictive power.
18 syls
checking: As Newcomb's Problem is usually told, the predictive process involved is extremely reliable.
18 syls
checking: But that is inessential.
error
checking: The disagreement between conceptions of rationality that gives the problem its interest arises even when the reliability of the process, as estimated by the agent, is quite poor—indeed, even when the agent judges that the predictive process will do little better than chance.
18 syls
checking: More precisely, define average estimated reliability as the average of (A) the agent's conditional degree of belief that the predictive process will predict correctly, given that he takes his thousand, and (B) his conditional degree of belief that the process will predict correctly, given that he does not take his thousand.
19 syls
checking: (When the predictive process is a simulation, for instance, we have the average of two conditional degrees of belief that the agent and his replica will decide alike.
18 syls
checking: ) Let r be the ratio of the value of the thousand to the value of the million: .
19 syls
checking: 001 if value is proportional to money, perhaps somewhat more under diminishing marginal value.
error
checking: We have a disagreement between two conceptions of rationality if and only if the expected value4 of taking the thousand is less than that of declining it, which is so if and only if the average estimated reliability exceeds (1 + r)/2.
19 syls
checking: (That is .
2 syls
checking: 5005 if value is proportional end p.302 to money.
error
checking: ) This is not a very high standard of reliability.
16 syls
checking: So there can be a fully problematic case of Newcomb's Problem in which the predictive process consists of simulation by some very imperfect and very unreliable replica.
18 syls
checking: The most readily available sort of replica of me is simply another person, placed in a replica of my predicament.
19 syls
checking: For instance: you, my fellow prisoner.
10 syls
checking: Most likely you are not a very exact replica of me, and your choice is not a very reliable predictive process for mine.
18 syls
checking: 5 Still, you might well be reliable enough (in my estimation) for a Newcomb Problem.
error
checking: 6 So we have this special case of (3"'):  (3) I will get my million if and only if you do not take your thousand.
error
checking: Inessential trappings aside, Prisoner's Dilemma is a version of Newcomb's Problem, quod erat demonstrandum.
error
checking: Some who discuss Newcomb's Problem think it is rational to decline the thousand if the predictive process is reliable enough.
18 syls
checking: Their reason is that they believe, justifiably, that those who decline their thousands will probably get their millions.
18 syls
checking: Some who discuss Prisoners' Dilemma think it is rational not to rat if the two partners are enough alike.
18 syls
checking: 7 Their reason is that they believe, justifiably, that those who do not rat will probably not be ratted on by their like-thinking partners.
error
checking: These two opinions are one opinion in two guises.
14 syls
checking: But some—I, for one—who discuss Newcomb's Problem think it is rational to take the thousand no matter how reliable the predictive process may be.
19 syls
checking: Our reason is that one thereby gets a thousand more than he would if he declined, since he would get his million or not regardless of whether he took his thousand.
18 syls
checking: And some—I, for one—who discuss Prisoners' Dilemma think it is rational to rat no matter how much end p.303 alike the two partners may be, and no matter how certain they may be that they will decide alike.
20 syls
checking: Our reason is that one is better off if he rats than he would be if he didn't, since he would be ratted on or not regardless of whether he ratted.
18 syls
checking: These two opinions also are one.
9 syls
checking: Some have fended off the lessons of Newcomb's Problem by saying: "Let us not have, or let us not rely on, any intuitions about what is rational in goofball cases so unlike the decision problems of real life".
18 syls
checking: But Prisoners' Dilemmas are deplorably common in real life.
error
checking: They are the most down-to-earth versions of Newcomb's Problem now available.
20 syls
checking: end p.304 Twenty-Seven Causal Decision Theory 1.
error
checking: Introduction Decision theory in its best-known form1 manages to steer clear of the thought that what's best to do is what the agent believes will most tend to cause good results.
error
checking: Causal relations and the like go unmentioned.
12 syls
checking: The theory is simple, elegant, powerful, and conceptually economical.
18 syls
checking: Unfortunately it is not quite right.
10 syls
checking: In a class of somewhat peculiar cases, called Newcomb problems, this noncausal decision theory gives the wrong answer.
error
checking: It commends an irrational policy of managing the news so as to get good news about matters which you have no control over.
18 syls
checking: I am one of those who have concluded that we need an improved decision theory, more sensitive to causal distinctions.
19 syls
checking: Noncausal decision theory will do when the causal relations are right for it, as they very often are, but even then the full story is causal.
error
checking: Several versions of causal decision theory are on the market in the works of end p.305 Gibbard and Harper, Skyrms, and Sobel,2 and I shall put forward a version of my own.
18 syls
checking: But also I shall suggest that we causal decision theorists share one common idea, and differ mainly on matters of emphasis and formulation.
18 syls
checking: The situation is not the chaos of disparate approaches that it may seem.
18 syls
checking: Of course there are many philosophers who understand the issues very well, and yet disagree with me about which choice in a Newcomb problem is rational.
19 syls
checking: This paper is about a topic that does not arise for them.
16 syls
checking: Noncausal decision theory meets their needs and they want no replacement.
error
checking: I will not enter into debate with them, since that debate is hopelessly deadlocked and I have nothing new to add to it.
19 syls
checking: Rather, I address myself to those who join me in presupposing that Newcomb problems show the need for some sort of causal decision theory, and in asking what form that theory should take.
error
checking: 2.
error
checking: Preliminaries: Credence, Value, Options  Let us assume that a (more or less) rational agent has, at any moment, a credence function and a value function.
18 syls
checking: These are defined in the first instance over single possible worlds.
17 syls
added: These are defined in the first instance over single possible worlds.
checking: Each world W has a credence C(W), which measures the agent's degree of belief that W is the actual world.
19 syls
checking: These credences fall on a scale from zero to one, and they sum to one.
error
checking: Also each world W has a value V(W), which measures how satisfactory it seems to the agent for W to be the actual world.
18 syls
checking: These values fall on a linear scale with arbitrary zero and unit.
18 syls
checking: We may go on to define credence also for sets of worlds.
15 syls
checking: We call such sets propositions, and we say that a proposition holds at just those worlds which are its members.
18 syls
checking: I shall not distinguish in notation between a world W and a proposition whose sole member is W, so all that is said of propositions shall apply also to single worlds.
18 syls
checking: We sum credences: for any proposition X, C(X) =df ∑W∈X C(W).
error
checking: end p.306 We define conditional credences as quotients of credences, defined if the denominator is positive: C(X/Y) =df C(XY)/C(Y), where XY is the conjunction (intersection) of the propositions X and Y. If C(Y) is positive, then C(−/Y), the function that assigns to any world W or proposition X the value C(W/Y) or C(X/Y), is itself a credence function.
error
checking: We say that it comes from C by conditionalising on Y. Conditionalising on one's total evidence is a rational way to learn from experience.
error
checking: I shall proceed on the assumption that it is the only way for a fully rational agent to learn from experience; however, nothing very important will depend on that disputed premise.
18 syls
checking: We also define (expected) value for propositions.
15 syls
checking: We take credence-weighted averages of values of worlds: for any proposition X, V(X) =df ∑W C(W/X)V(W) = ∑W∈X C(W)V(W)/C(X).
21 syls
checking: A partition (or a partition of X) is a set of propositions of which exactly one holds at any world (or at any X-world).
19 syls
checking: Let the variable Z range over any partition (in which case the XZ's, for fixed X and varying Z, are a partition of X).
18 syls
checking: Our definitions yield the following Rules of Additivity for credence, and for the product of credence and expected value: (1) C(X) = ∑Z C(XZ), C(X)V(X) = ∑Z C(XZ)V(XZ).
error
checking: This Rule of Averaging for expected values follows: (2) V(X) = ∑Z C(Z/X)V(XZ).
error
checking: Thence we can get an alternative definition of expected value.
19 syls
checking: For any number v, let [V = v] be the proposition that holds at just those worlds W for which V(W) equals v. Call [V = v] a valuelevel proposition.
18 syls
checking: Since the value-level propositions are a partition, (3) V(X) = ∑v C([V = v]/X)v.
error
checking: I have idealised and oversimplified in three ways, but I think the dodged complications make no difference to whether, and how, decision theory ought to be causal.
error
checking: First, it seems most unlikely that any real person could store and process anything so rich in information as the C and V functions evisaged.
18 syls
checking: We must perforce make do with summaries.
10 syls
checking: But it is plausible that someone who really did have these functions to guide him would not be so very different from us in his conduct, apart from his supernatural prowess at logic and mathematics and a priori knowledge generally.
18 syls
checking: Second, my formulation makes end p.307 straightforward sense only under the fiction that the number of possible worlds is finite.
error
checking: There are two remedies.
6 syls
checking: We could reformulate everything in the language of standard measure theory, or we could transfer our simpler formulations to the infinite case by invoking nonstandard summations of infinitesimal credences.
18 syls
checking: Either way the technicalities would distract us, and I see little risk that the fiction of finitude will mislead us.
18 syls
checking: Third, a credence function over possible worlds allows for partial beliefs about the way the world is, but not for partial beliefs about who and where and when in the world one is.
19 syls
checking: Beliefs of the second sort are distinct from those of the first sort; it is  important that we have them; however, they are seldom very partial.
18 syls
checking: To make them partial we need either an agent strangely lacking in self-knowledge, or else one who gives credence to strange worlds in which he has close duplicates.
18 syls
checking: I here ignore the decision problems of such strange agents.
15 syls
checking: 3 Let us next consider the agent's options.
error
checking: Suppose we have a partition of propositions that distinguish worlds where the agent acts differently (he or his counterpart, as the case may be).
18 syls
checking: Further, he can act at will so as to make any one of these propositions hold, but he cannot act at will so as to make any proposition hold that implies but is not implied by (is properly included in) a proposition in the partition.
20 syls
checking: The partition gives the most detailed specifications of his present action over which he has control.
18 syls
checking: Then this is the partition of the agents' alternative options.
17 syls
added: Then this is the partition of the agents' alternative options.
checking: 4 (Henceforth I reserve the variable A to range over these options.
error
checking: ) Say that the agent realises an option iff he acts in such a way as to make it hold.
error
checking: Then the business of decision theory is to say which of the agent's alternative options it would be rational for him to realise.
18 syls
checking: All this is neutral ground.
6 syls
checking: Credence, value, and options figure both in noncausal and in causal decision theory, though of course they are put to somewhat different uses.
error
checking: 3.
error
checking: Noncausal Decision Theory Noncausal decision theory needs no further apparatus.
error
checking: It prescribes the rule of Vmaximising, according to which a rational choice is one end p.308 that has the greatest expected value.
error
checking: An option A is V-maximal iff V(A) is not exceeded by any V(A′), where A′ is another option.
error
checking: The theory says that to act rationally is to realise some Vmaximal option.
error
checking: Here is the guiding intuition.
9 syls
checking: How would you like to find out that A holds?
10 syls
checking: Your estimate of the value of the actual world would then be V(A), if you learn by conditionalising on the news that A. So you would like best to find out that the V-maximal one of the A's holds (or one of the Vmaximal ones, in case of a tie).
18 syls
checking: But it's in your power to find out that whichever one you like holds, by realising it.
18 syls
checking: So go ahead—find out whichever you'd like best to find out!
16 syls
checking: You make the news, so make the news you like best.
11 syls
checking: This seeking of good news may not seem so sensible, however, if it turns out to get in the way of seeking good results.
18 syls
checking: And it does.
3 syls
checking: 4.
error
checking: Newcomb Problems Suppose you are offered some small good, take it or leave it.
18 syls
checking: Also you may suffer some great evil, but you are convinced that whether you suffer it or not is entirely outside your control.
18 syls
checking: In no way does it depend causally on what you do now.
error
checking: No other significant payoffs are at stake.
12 syls
checking: Is it rational to take the small good?
10 syls
checking: Of course, say I. I think enough has been said already to settle that question, but there is some more to say.
18 syls
checking: Suppose further that you think that some prior state, which may or may not obtain and which also is entirely outside your control, would be conducive both to your deciding to take the good and to your suffering the evil.
19 syls
checking: So if you take the good, that will be evidence that the prior state does obtain and hence that you stand more chance than you might have hoped of suffering the evil.
18 syls
checking: Bad news!
2 syls
checking: But is that any reason not to take the good?
12 syls
checking: I say not, since if the prior state obtains, there's nothing you can do about it now.
18 syls
checking: In particular, you cannot make it go away by declining the good, thus acting as you would have been more likely to act if the prior state had been absent.
18 syls
checking: All you accomplish is to shield yourself from the bad news.
14 syls
checking: That is useless.
4 syls
checking: (Ex hypothesi, dismay caused by the bad news is not a significant extra payoff in its own right.
error
checking: Neither is the exhilaration or merit of boldly facing the worst.
18 syls
checking: ) To decline the good lest taking it bring bad news is to play the ostrich.
18 syls
checking: The trouble with noncausal decision theory is that it commends the ostrich as rational.
error
checking: Let G and −G respectively be the propositions that you take the small good and that you decline it; suppose for simplicity that just  end p.309 these are your options.
18 syls
checking: Let E and −E respectively be the propositions that you suffer the evil and that you do not.
18 syls
checking: Let the good contribute g to the value of a world and let the evil contribute −e; suppose the two to be additive, and set an arbitrary zero where both are absent.
19 syls
checking: Then by Averaging, (4) V(-G) = C(E/-G)V(E-G) + C(-E/-G)V(-E-G) = -eC(E/-G) V(G) = C(E/G)V(EG) + C(-E/G)V(-EG) = -eC(E/G) + g That means that −G, declining the good, is the V-maximal option iff the difference (C(E/G) − C(E/−G)), which may serve as a measure of the extent to which taking the good brings bad news, exceeds the fraction g/e.
error
checking: And that may well be so under the circumstances considered.
16 syls
checking: If it is, noncausal decision theory endorses the ostrich's useless policy of managing the news.
error
checking: It tells you to decline the good, though doing so does not at all tend to prevent the evil.
18 syls
checking: If a theory tells you that, it stands refuted.
12 syls
checking: In Newcomb's original problem,5 verisimilitude was sacrificed for extremity.
error
checking: C(E/G) was close to one and C(E/−G) was close to zero, so that declining the good turned out to be V-maximal by an overwhelming margin.
18 syls
checking: To make it so, we have to imagine someone with the mind-boggling power to detect the entire vast combination of causal factors at some earlier time that would cause you to decline the good, in order to inflict the evil if any such combination is present.
18 syls
checking: Some philosophers have refused to learn anything from such a tall story.
19 syls
checking: If our aim is to show the need for causal decision theory, however, a more moderate version of Newcomb's problem will serve as well.
20 syls
checking: Even if the difference of C(E/G) and C(E/−G) is quite small, provided that it exceeds g/e, we have a counterexample.
18 syls
checking: More moderate versions can also be more down-to-earth, as witness the medical Newcomb problems.
18 syls
checking: 6 Suppose you like eating eggs, or smoking, or loafing when end p.310 you might go out and run.
error
checking: You are convinced, contrary to popular belief, that these pleasures will do you no harm at all.
18 syls
checking: (Whether you are right about this is irrelevant.
13 syls
checking: ) But also you think you might have some dread medical condition: a lesion of an artery, or nascent cancer, or a weak heart.
19 syls
checking: If you have it, there's nothing you can do about it now and it will probably do you a lot of harm eventually.
18 syls
checking: In its earlier stages, this condition is hard to detect.
16 syls
checking: But you are convinced that it has some tendency, perhaps slight, to cause you to eat eggs, smoke, or loaf.
18 syls
checking: So if you find yourself indulging, that is at least some evidence that you have the condition and are in for big trouble.
18 syls
checking: But is that any reason not to indulge in harmless pleasures?
16 syls
checking: The V-maximising rule says yes, if the numbers are right.
error
checking: I say no.
3 syls
checking: So far, I have considered pure Newcomb problems.
12 syls
checking: There are also mixed problems.
7 syls
checking: You may think that taking the good has some tendency to produce (or prevent) the evil, but also is a manifestation of some prior state which tends to produce the evil.
19 syls
processed: 6000
checking: Or you may be uncertain whether your situation is a Newcomb problem or not, dividing your credence between alternative hypotheses about the causal relations that prevail.
18 syls
checking: These mixed cases are still more realistic, yet even they can refute noncausal decision theory.
18 syls
checking: However, no Newcomb problem, pure or mixed, can refute anything if it is not possible.
18 syls
checking: The Tickle Defence of noncausal decision theory7 questions whether Newcomb problems really can arise.
error
checking: It runs as follows: "Supposedly the prior state that tends to cause the evil also tends to cause you to take the good.
18 syls
checking: The dangerous lesion causes you to choose to eat eggs, or whatever.
18 syls
checking: How can it do that?
5 syls
checking: If you are fully rational your choices are governed entirely by your beliefs and desires so nothing can influence your choices except by influencing your beliefs and desires.
18 syls
checking: But if you are fully rational, you know your own mind.
14 syls
checking: If the lesion produces beliefs and desires favourable to eating eggs, you will be aware of those beliefs and desires at the outset of deliberation.
error
checking: So you won't have to wait until you find yourself eating eggs to get the bad news.
18 syls
checking: You will have it already when you feel that tickle in the tastebuds—or whatever introspectible state it might be— end p.311 that manifests your desire for eggs.
error
checking: Your consequent choice tells you nothing more.
10 syls
checking: By the time you decide whether to eat eggs, your credence function already has been modified by the  evidence of the tickle.
19 syls
checking: Then C(E/G) does not exceed C(E/−G), their difference is zero and so does not exceed g/e, −G is not V-maximal, and noncausal decision theory does not make the mistake of telling you not to eat the eggs".
18 syls
checking: I reply that the Tickle Defence does establish that a Newcomb problem cannot arise for a fully rational agent, but that decision theory should not be limited to apply only to the fully rational agent.
19 syls
checking: 8 Not so, at least, if rationality is taken to include self-knowledge.
error
checking: May we not ask what choice would be rational for the partly rational agent, and whether or not his partly rational methods of decision will steer him correctly?
18 syls
checking: A partly rational agent may very well be in a moderate Newcomb problem, either because his choices are influenced by something besides his beliefs and desires or because he cannot quite tell the strengths of his beliefs and desires before he acts.
18 syls
checking: ("How can I tell what I think till I see what I say"?
13 syls
checking: —E.
1 syls
checking: M. Forster.
3 syls
checking: ) For the dithery and the self-deceptive, no amount of Gedankenexperimente in decision can provide as much self-knowledge as the real thing.
error
checking: So even if the Tickle Defence shows that noncausal decision theory gives the right answer under powerful assumptions of rationality (whether or not for the right reasons), Newcomb problems still show that a general decision theory must be causal.
error
checking: 5.
error
checking: Utility and Dependency Hypotheses Suppose someone knows all there is to know about how the things he cares about do and do not depend causally on his present actions.
18 syls
checking: If something is beyond his control, so that it will obtain—or have a certain end p.312 chance of obtaining—no matter what he does, then he knows that for certain.
18 syls
checking: And if something is within his control, he knows that for certain; further, he knows the extent of his influence over it and he knows what he must do to influence it one way or another.
18 syls
checking: Then there can be no Newcomb problems for him.
11 syls
checking: Whatever news his actions may bring, they cannot change his mind about the likely outcomes of his alternative actions.
18 syls
checking: He knew it all before.
6 syls
checking: Let us call the sort of proposition that this agent knows—a maximally specific proposition about how the things he cares about do and do not depend causally on his present actions—a dependency hypothesis (for that agent at that time).
error
checking: Since there must be some truth or other on the subject, and since the dependency hypotheses are maximally specific and cannot differ without conflicting, they comprise a partition.
20 syls
checking: Exactly one of them holds at any world, and it specifies the relevant relations of causal dependence that prevail there.
20 syls
checking: It would make no difference if our know-it-all didn't really know.
error
checking: If he concentrates all his credence on a single dependency hypothesis, whether rightly or wrongly, then there can be no Newcomb problems for him.
21 syls
checking: His actions cannot bring him news about which dependency hypothesis holds if he already is quite certain which one it is.
19 syls
checking: Within a single dependency hypothesis, so to speak, V-maximising is right.
error
checking: It is rational to seek good news by doing that which, according to the dependency hypothesis you believe, most tends to produce good results.
18 syls
checking: That is the same as seeking good results.
10 syls
checking: Failures of V-maximising appear only if, first, you are sensible enough to spread your credence over several dependency hypotheses, and second, your actions might be evidence for some dependency hypotheses and against others.
error
checking: That is what may enable the agent to seek good news not in the proper way, by seeking good results, but rather by doing what would be evidence for a good dependency hypothesis.
19 syls
checking: That is the recipe for Newcomb problems.
11 syls
checking: What should you do if you spread your credence over several dependency hypotheses?
18 syls
checking: You should consider the expected value of your options under the several hypotheses; you should weight these by the credences you attach to the hypotheses; and you should maximise the weighted average.
18 syls
checking: Henceforth I reserve the variable K to range over dependency hypotheses (or over members of partitions that play a parallel role in other versions of causal decision theory).
19 syls
checking: Let us define the (expected) utility of an option A by: U(A) =df ∑K C(K)V(AK).
18 syls
checking: end p.313 My version of causal decision theory prescribes the rule of U-maximising according to which a rational choice is one that has the greatest expected utility.
error
checking: Option A is U-maximal iff U(A) is not exceeded by any U(A′), and to act rationally is to realise some U-maximal option.
error
checking: In putting this forward as the rule of rational decision, of course I speak for myself; but I hope I have found a neutral formulation which fits not only my version of causal decision theory but also the versions proposed by Gibbard and Harper, Skyrms, and Sobel.
18 syls
checking: There are certainly differences about the nature of dependency hypotheses; but if I am right, these are small matters compared to our common advocacy of utility maximising as just defined.
19 syls
checking: In distinguishing as I have between V and U—value and utility—I have followed the notation of Gibbard and Harper.
20 syls
checking: But also I think I have followed the lead of ordinary language, in which "utility" means much the same as "usefulness".
18 syls
checking: Certainly the latter term is causal.
10 syls
checking: Which would you call the useful action: the one that tends to produce good results?
19 syls
checking: Or the one that does no good at all (or even a little harm) and yet is equally welcome because it is a sign of something else that does produce good results?
18 syls
checking: (Assume again that the news is not valued for its own sake.
15 syls
checking: ) Surely the first—and that is the one with greater utility in my terminology, though both may have equal value.
18 syls
checking: It is essential to define utility as we did using the unconditional credences C(K) of dependency hypotheses, not their conditional credences C(K/A).
18 syls
checking: If the two differ, any difference expresses exactly that news-bearing aspect of the options that we meant to suppress.
18 syls
checking: Had we used the conditional credences, we would have arrived at nothing different from V. For the Rule of Averaging applies to any partition; and hence to the partition of dependency hypotheses, giving (5) V(A) = ∑K C(K/A)V(AK).
error
checking: Let us give noncausal decision theory its due before we take leave of it.
error
checking: It works whenever the dependency hypotheses are probabilistically independent of the options, so that all the C(K/A)'s equal the corresponding C(K)'s.
error
checking: Then by (5) and the definition of U, the corresponding V(A)'s and U(A)'s also are equal.
error
checking: V-maximising gives the same right answers as U-maximising.
error
checking: The Tickle Defence seems to show that the K's must be independent of the A's for any fully rational agent.
18 syls
checking: Even for partly rational agents, it seems plausible that they are at least close to independent in most realistic cases.
18 syls
checking: Then indeed V-maximising works.
error
checking: But it works because the agent's beliefs about causal dependence end p.314 are such as to make it work.
18 syls
checking: It does not work for reasons which leave causal relations out of the story.
19 syls
checking: I am suggesting that we ought to undo a seeming advance in the development of decision theory.
18 syls
checking: Everyone agrees that it would be ridiculous to maximise the "expected utility" defined by ∑Z C(Z)V(AZ) where Z ranges over just any old partition.
error
checking: It would lead to different answers for different partitions.
16 syls
checking: For the partition of value-level propositions, for instance, it would tell us fatalistically that all options are equally good!
18 syls
checking: What to do?
3 syls
checking: Savage suggested, in effect, that we make the calculation with unconditional credences, but make sure to use only the right sort of partition.
22 syls
checking: 9 But what sort is that?
error
checking: Jeffrey responded that we would do better to make the calculation with conditional credences, as in the right hand side of (2).
18 syls
checking: Then we need not be selective about partitions, since we get the same answer, namely V(A), for all of them.
18 syls
checking: In a way, Jeffrey himself was making decision theory causal.
17 syls
added: In a way, Jeffrey himself was making decision theory causal.
checking: But he did it by using probabilistic dependence as a mark of causal dependence, and unfortunately the two need not always go together.
error
checking: So I have thought it better to return to unconditional credences and say what sort of partition is right.
error
checking: As I have formulated it, causal decision theory is causal in two different ways.
18 syls
checking: The dependency hypotheses are causal in their content: they class worlds together on the basis of likenesses of causal dependence.
18 syls
checking: But also the dependency hypotheses themselves are causally independent of the agent's actions.
error
checking: They specify his influence over other things, but over them he has no influence.
18 syls
checking: (Suppose he did.
4 syls
checking: Consider the dependency hypothesis which we get by taking  account of the ways the agent can manipulate dependency hypotheses to enhance his control over other things.
18 syls
checking: This hypothesis seems to be right no matter what he does.
15 syls
checking: Then he has no influence over whether this hypothesis or another is right, contrary to our supposition that the dependency hypotheses are within his influence.
20 syls
checking: ) Dependency hypotheses are "act-independent states" in a causal sense, though not necessarily in the probabilistic sense.
19 syls
checking: If we say that the right sort of partition for calculating expected utility is a causally act-independent one, then the partition end p.315 of dependency hypotheses qualifies.
19 syls
checking: But I think it is better to say just that the right partition is the partition of dependency hypotheses, in which case the emphasis is on their causal content rather than their act-independence.
18 syls
checking: If any of the credences C(AK) is zero, the rule of U-maximising falls silent.
error
checking: For in that case V(AK) becomes an undefined sum of quotients with denominator zero, so U(A) in turn is undefined and A cannot be compared in utility with the other options.
error
checking: Should that silence worry us?
7 syls
checking: I think not, for the case ought never to arise.
12 syls
checking: It may seem that it arises in the most extreme sort of Newcomb problem: suppose that taking the good is thought to make it absolutely certain that the prior state obtains and the evil will follow.
19 syls
checking: Then if A is the option of taking the good and K says that the agent stands a chance of escaping the evil, C(AK) is indeed zero and U(A) is indeed undefined.
19 syls
checking: What should you do in such an extreme Newcomb problem?
13 syls
checking: V-maximise after all?
error
checking: No; what you should do is not be in that problem in the first place.
16 syls
checking: Nothing should ever be held as certain as all that, with the possible exception of the testimony of the senses.
18 syls
checking: Absolute certainty is tantamount to firm resolve never to change your mind no matter what, and that is objectionable.
18 syls
checking: However much reason you may get to think that option A will not be realised if K holds, you will not if you are rational lower C(AK) quite to zero.
18 syls
checking: Let it by all means get very, very small; but very, very small denominators do not make utilities go undefined.
error
checking: What of the partly rational agent, whom I have no wish to ignore?
18 syls
checking: Might he not rashly lower some credence C(AK) all the way to zero?
error
checking: I am inclined to think not.
7 syls
checking: What makes it so that someone has a certain credence is that its ascription to him is part of a systematic pattern of ascriptions, both to him and to others like him, both as they are and as they would have been had events gone a bit differently, that does the best job overall of rationalising behaviour.
error
checking: 10 I find it hard to see how the ascription of rash zeros could be part of such a best pattern.
error
checking: It seems that a pattern that ascribes very small positive values instead always could do just a bit better, rationalising the same behaviour without gratuitously ascribing the objectionable zeros.
19 syls
checking: If I am right end p.316 about this, rash zeros are one sort of irrationality that is downright impossible.
error
checking: 11 6.
error
checking: Reformulations The causal decision theory proposed above can be reformulated in various equivalent ways.
error
checking: These will give us some further understanding of the theory, and will help us in comparing it with other proposed versions of causal decision theory.
18 syls
checking: Expansions: We can apply the Rule of Averaging to expand the V(AK)'s that appear in our definition of expected utility.
18 syls
checking: Let Z range over any partition.
10 syls
added:  I am inclined to think not. Let Z range over any partition.
checking: Then we have (6) U(A) = ∑K ∑Z C(K)C(Z/AK)V(AKZ).
error
checking: (If any C(AKZ) is zero we may take the term for K and Z as zero, despite the fact the V(AKZ) is undefined.
error
checking: ) This seems only to make a simple thing complicated; but if the partition is well chosen, (6) may serve to express the utility of an option in terms of quantities that we find it comparatively easy to judge.
20 syls
checking: Let us call a partition rich iff, for every member S of that partition and for every option A and dependency hypothesis K, V(AKS) equals V(AS).
error
checking: That means that the AS's describe outcomes of options so fully that the addition of a dependency hypothesis tells us no more about the features of the outcome that matter to the agent.
18 syls
checking: Henceforth I reserve the variable S to range over rich  partitions.
19 syls
checking: Given richness of the partition, we can factor the value terms in (6) part way out, to obtain (7) U(A) = ∑S (∑K C(K)C(S/AK)) V(AS).
18 syls
checking: Equation (7) for expected utility resembles equation (2) for expected value, except that the inner sum in (7) replaces the conditional credence C(S/A) in the corresponding instance of (2).
error
checking: As we shall see, the analogy can be pushed further.
14 syls
checking: Two examples of rich partitions to end p.317 which (7) applies are the partition of possible worlds and the partition of value-level propositions [V = v].
error
checking: Imaging: Suppose we have a function that selects, for any pair of a world W and a suitable proposition X, a probability distribution W X .
18 syls
checking: Suppose further that W X assigns probability only to X-worlds, so that W X (X) equals one.
18 syls
checking: (Hence at least the empty proposition must not be "suitable".
16 syls
checking: ) Call the function an imaging function, and call W X the image of W on X. The image might be sharp, if W X puts all its probability on a single world; or it might be blurred, with the probability spread over more than one world.
19 syls
checking: Given an imaging function, we can apply it to form images also of probability distributions.
18 syls
checking: We sum the superimposed images of all the worlds, weighting the images by the original probabilities of their source worlds.
20 syls
checking: For any pair of a probability distribution C and a suitable proposition X, we define C X , the image of C on X, as follows.
18 syls
checking: First, for any world W′, CX(W’) =df ∑W C(W)WX(W’); think of C(W)W X (W′) as the amount of probability that is moved from W to W′ in making the image.
error
checking: We sum as usual: for any proposition Y, CX(Y) =df ∑W∈Y CX(W).
error
checking: It is easy to check that C X also is a probability distribution; and that it assigns probability only to X-worlds, so that C X (X) equals one.
18 syls
checking: Imaging is one way—conditionalising is another—to revise a given probability distribution so that all the probability is concentrated on a given proposition.
error
checking: 12 For our present purposes, what we want are images of the agent's end p.318 credence function on his various options.
error
checking: The needed imaging function can be defined in terms of the partition of dependency hypotheses: let WA(W’) =df C(W’/AKW) for any option A and worlds W and W′, where K W is the dependency hypothesis that holds at W. In words: move the credence of world W over to the A-worlds in the same dependency hypothesis, and distribute it among those worlds in proportion to their original credence.
19 syls
checking: (Here again we would be in trouble if any of the C(AK)'s were zero, but I think we needn't worry.
error
checking: ) It follows from the several definitions just given that for any option A and proposition Y, (8) CA(Y) = ∑K C(K)C(Y/AK).
18 syls
checking: The inner sum in (7) therefore turns out to be the credence, imaged on A, of S. So by (7) and (8) together, (9) U(A) = ∑S CA(S)V(AS).
error
checking: Now we have something like the Rule of Averaging for expected value, except that the partition must be rich and we must image rather than conditionalising.
18 syls
checking: For the rich partition of possible worlds we have (10) U(A) = ∑W CA(W)V(W).
error
checking: which resembles the definition of expected value.
15 syls
checking: For the rich partition of value-level propositions we have something resembling (3): (11) U(A) = ∑v CA([V = v])v.
19 syls
checking: 7.
error
checking: Primitive Imaging: Sobel  To reformulate causal decision theory in terms of imaging, I proceeded in two steps.
18 syls
checking: I began with the dependency hypotheses and used them to define an imaging function; then I redefined the expected utility of an option in terms of imaging.
19 syls
checking: We could omit the first step and leave the dependency hypotheses out of it.
18 syls
checking: We could take the imaging function as primitive, and go on as I did to define expected utility by means of it.
18 syls
checking: That is the decision theory of J. Howard Sobel, op.
15 syls
checking: cit.
error
checking: Sobel starts with the images of worlds, which he calls world-tendencies.
17 syls
added: Sobel starts with the images of worlds, which he calls world-tendencies.
checking: (He considers images on all propositions possible relative to the given world, but for purposes of decision theory we can confine our attention to images on the agent's options.
19 syls
checking: ) Just as we defined C A end p.319 in terms of the W A 's, so Sobel goes on to define images of the agent's credence function.
error
checking: He uses these in turn to define expected utility in the manner of (10), and he advocates maximising the utility so defined rather than expected value.
18 syls
checking: Sobel unites his decision theory with a treatment of counterfactual conditionals in terms of closest antecedent-worlds.
error
checking: 13 If W A (W′) is positive, then we think of W′ as one of the A-worlds that is in some sense closest to the world W. What might be the case if it were the case that A, from the standpoint of W, is what holds at some such closest A-world; what would be the case if A, from the standpoint of W, is what holds at all of them.
error
checking: Sobel's apparatus gives us quantitative counterfactuals intermediate between the mights and the woulds.
error
checking: We can say that if it were that A, it would be with probability p that X; meaning that W A (X) equals p, or in Sobel's terminology that X holds on a subset of the closest A-worlds whose tendencies, at W and on the supposition A, sum to p. Though Sobel leaves the dependency hypotheses out of his decision theory, we can perhaps bring them back in.
18 syls
checking: Let us say that worlds image alike (on the agent's options) iff, for each option, their images on that option are exactly the same.
error
checking: Imaging alike is an equivalence relation, so we have the partition of its equivalence classes.
18 syls
checking: If we start with the dependency hypotheses and define the imaging function as I did, it is immediate that worlds image alike iff they are worlds where the same dependency hypothesis holds; so the equivalence classes turn out to be just the dependency hypotheses.
20 syls
checking: The question is whether dependency hypotheses could be brought into Sobel's theory by defining them as equivalence classes under the relation of imaging alike.
19 syls
checking: Each equivalence class could be described, in Sobel's terminology, as a maximally specific proposition about the tendencies of the world on all alternative suppositions about which option the agent realises.
19 syls
checking: That sounds like a dependency hypothesis to me.
14 syls
checking: Sobel tells me (personal communication, 1980) that he is inclined to agree, and does regard his decision theory as causal; though it is hard to tell that from his written presentation, in which causal language very seldom appears.
error
checking: If the proposal is to succeed technically, we need the following thesis: if K W is the equivalence class of W under the relation of imaging end p.320 alike (of having the same tendencies on each option) then, for any option A and world W′, W A (W′) equals C(W′/AK W ).
19 syls
checking: If so, it follows that if we start as Sobel does with the imaging function, defining the dependency hypotheses as equivalence classes, and thence defining an imaging function as I did, we will get back the same imaging function that we started with.
18 syls
checking: It further follows, by our results in Section 6, that expected utility calculated in my way from the defined dependency hypotheses is the same as expected utility calculated in Sobel's way from the imaging function.
error
checking: They must be the same, if the defined dependency hypotheses introduced into Sobel's theory are to play their proper role.
20 syls
checking: Unfortunately, the required thesis is not a part of Sobel's theory; it would be an extra constraint on the imaging function.
18 syls
checking: It does seem a very plausible constraint, at least in ordinary cases.
18 syls
checking: Sobel suspends judgement about imposing a weaker version of the thesis (Connection Thesis 1, discussed in his Section 6.
18 syls
checking: 7).
error
checking: But his reservations, which would carry over to our version, entirely concern the extraordinary case of an agent who thinks he may somehow have foreknowledge of the outcomes of chance processes.
21 syls
checking: Sobel gives no reason, and I know of none, to doubt either version of the thesis except in extraordinary cases of that sort.
18 syls
checking: Then if we assume the  thesis, it seems that we are only setting aside some very special cases—cases about which I, at least, have no firm views.
19 syls
checking: (I think them much more problematic for decision theory than the Newcomb problems.
19 syls
checking: ) So far as the remaining cases are concerned, it is satisfactory to introduce defined dependency hypotheses into Sobel's theory and thereby render it equivalent to mine.
18 syls
checking: 8.
error
checking: Factors Outside Our Influence: Skyrms Moving on to the version of causal decision theory proposed by Brian Skyrms, op.
error
checking: cit.
error
checking: , we find a theory that is formally just like mine.
13 syls
checking: Skyrms' definition of K-expectation—his name for the sort of expected utility that should be maximised—is our equation (6).
error
checking: From that, with a trivial partition of Z's, we can immediately recover my first definition of expected utility.
20 syls
checking: Skyrms introduces a partition of hypotheses—the K's which give K-expectation its name—that play just the same role in his calculation of expected utility that the dependency hypotheses play in mine.
error
checking: (Thus I have followed Skyrms in notation.
error
checking: ) So the only difference, if it is a difference, is in how the K's are characterised.
18 syls
checking: end p.321 Skyrms describes them at the outset as maximally specific specifications of the factors outside the agent's influence (at the time of decision) which are causally relevant to the outcome of the agent's action.
error
checking: He gives another characterisation later, but let us take the first one first.
error
checking: I ask what Skyrms means to count as a "factor".
error
checking: Under a sufficiently broad construal, I have no objection to Skyrms' theory and I think it no different from mine.
error
checking: On a narrower and more literal construal, I do not think Skyrms' theory is adequate as a general theory of rational decision, though I think that in practice it will often serve.
error
checking: Insofar as Skyrms is serving up a general theory rather than practical rules of thumb, I think it is indeed the broad construal that he intends.
error
checking: (I also ask what Skyrms means by "relevant to the outcome".
error
checking: I can't see how any factor, broadly or narrowly construed, could fail to be relevant to some aspect of the outcome.
18 syls
checking: If the outcome is that I win a million dollars tomorrow, one aspect of this outcome may be that it takes place just one thousand years after some peasant felled an oak with ninety strokes of his axe.
19 syls
checking: So I suppose Skyrms' intent was to include only factors relevant to those features of the outcome that the agent cares about, as opposed to those that are matters of indifference to him.
error
checking: That would parallel a like exclusion of matters of indifference in my definition of dependency hypotheses.
18 syls
checking: In neither case is the exclusion important.
12 syls
checking: Richer hypotheses, cluttered with matters of indifference, ought to give the same answers.
18 syls
checking: ) On the broad construal, a "factor" need not be the sort of localised particular occurrence that we commonly think of as causing or being caused.
error
checking: It might be any matter of contingent fact whatever.
15 syls
checking: It might indeed be some particular occurrence.
13 syls
checking: It might be a vast dispersed pattern of occurrences throughout the universe.
20 syls
checking: It might be a law of nature.
8 syls
checking: It might be a dependency hypothesis.
12 syls
checking: On the broad construal, Skyrms is saying only that the K's are maximally specific propositions about matters outside the agent's influence and relevant to features of the outcome that the agent cares about.
error
checking: A dependency hypothesis is outside the agent's influence.
19 syls
checking: It is relevant to features of the outcome that he cares about.
17 syls
added: It is relevant to features of the outcome that he cares about.
checking: (Causally relevant?
error
checking: —Not clear, but if we're construing "factor" broadly, we can let that by as well.
error
checking: ) Any specification of something outside the agent's influence is included in a dependency hypothesis—recall that they cover what doesn't depend on the agent's actions as well as what does—unless it concerns something the agent doesn't care about.
19 syls
checking: I conclude that on the broad construal, Skyrms' K's are nothing else end p.322 than the dependency hypotheses.
error
checking: In that case his theory is the same as mine.
11 syls
checking: On the narrow construal, a "factor" must be the sort of localised occurrence—event, state, omission, etc.
error
checking: —that we normally think of as a cause.
10 syls
checking: In the medical Newcomb problems, for instance, the lesion or the nascent cancer or the weak heart is a causal factor narrowly and literally.
19 syls
checking: In motivating his theory, it is factors like these that Skyrms considers.
error
checking: Our topic is rational decision according to the agent's beliefs, be they right or wrong.
18 syls
checking: So it seems that we should take not the factors which really are outside his influence, but rather those he thinks are outside his influence.
18 syls
checking: But what if he divides his credence between several hypotheses as to which factors are outside his influence, as well he might?
18 syls
checking: Skyrms responds to this challenge by redescribing his partition of hypotheses.
error
checking: On his new description, each hypothesis consists of two parts: (i) a preliminary hypothesis specifying which of the relevant causal factors are outside the agent's influence, and (ii) a full specification of those factors that are outside his influence according to part (i).
18 syls
checking: That is a welcome amendment, but I think it does not go far enough.
18 syls
checking: Influence is a matter of degree, so shouldn't the hypotheses say not just that the agent has some influence over a factor or none, but also how much?
error
checking: And if the hypothesis says that the agent has influence over a factor, shouldn't it also say which way the influence goes?
18 syls
checking: Given that I can influence the temperature, do I make it cooler by turning the knob clockwise or counterclockwise?
18 syls
checking: Make Skyrms' amendment and the other needed amendments, and you will have the dependency hypotheses back again.
error
checking: To illustrate my point, consider an agent with eccentric beliefs.
18 syls
checking: He thinks the influence of his actions ramifies but also fades, so that everything in the far future is within his influence but only a little bit.
error
checking: Perhaps he thinks that his actions raise and lower the chances of future occurrences, but only very slightly.
18 syls
checking: Also he thinks that time is circular, so that the far future includes the present and the immediate past and indeed all of history.
18 syls
checking: Then he gives all his credence to a single one of Skyrms' two-part hypotheses: the one saying that no occurrence whatever—no factor, on the narrow construal—is entirely outside his influence.
error
checking: That means that on Skyrms' calculation his U(A)'s reduce to the corresponding V(A)'s, so V-maximising is right for him.
error
checking: That's wrong.
3 syls
checking: Since he thinks he has very little influence over whether he has the dread lesion, his decision problem about eating eggs is very little end p.323 different from that of someone who thinks the lesion is entirely outside his influence.
18 syls
checking: Vmaximising should come out wrong for very much the same reason in both cases.
error
checking: No such difficulty threatens Skyrms' proposal broadly construed.
error
checking: The agent may well wonder which of the causal factors narrowly construed are within his influence, but he cannot rationally doubt that the dependency hypotheses are entirely outside it.
19 syls
checking: On the broad construal, Skyrms' second description of the partition of hypotheses is a gloss on the first, not an amendment.
error
checking: The hypotheses already specify which of the (narrow) factors are outside the agent's influence, for that is itself a (broad) factor outside his influence.
18 syls
checking: Skyrms notes this, and that is why I think it must be the broad construal that he intends.
error
checking: Likewise the degrees and directions of influence over (narrow) factors are themselves (broad) factors outside the agent's influence, hence already specified according to the broad construal of Skyrms' first description.
19 syls
checking: Often, to be sure, the difference between the broad and narrow construals will not matter.
error
checking: There may well be a correlation, holding throughout the worlds which enjoy significant credence, between dependency hypotheses and combinations of (narrow) factors outside the agent's influence.
18 syls
checking: The difference between good and bad dependency hypotheses may in practice amount to the difference between absence and presence of a lesion.
18 syls
checking: However, I find it rash to assume that there must always be some handy correlation to erase the difference between the broad and narrow construals.
19 syls
checking: Dependency hypotheses do indeed hold in virtue of lesions and the like, but they hold also in virtue of the laws of nature.
18 syls
checking: It would seem that uncertainty about dependency hypotheses might come at least partly from uncertainty about the laws.
18 syls
checking: Skyrms is sympathetic, as am I,14 to the neo-Humean thesis that every contingent truth about a world—law, dependency hypothesis, or what you will—holds somehow in virtue of that world's total history of manifest matters of particular fact.
error
checking: Same history, same everything.
8 syls
checking: But that falls short of implying that dependency hypotheses hold just in virtue of casual factors, narrowly construed; they might hold partly in virtue of dispersed patterns of particular fact throughout history, including the future and the distant present.
18 syls
checking: Further, even if we are end p.324  inclined to accept the neo-Humean thesis, it still seems safer not to make it a presupposition of our decision theory.

error
checking: Counterfactual Dependence: Gibbard and Harper If we want to express a dependency hypothesis in ordinary language, it is hard to avoid the use of counterfactual conditionals saying what would happen if the agent were to realise his various alternative options.
error
checking: Suppose that on a certain occasion I'm interested in getting Bruce to purr.
18 syls
checking: I could try brushing, stroking, or leaving alone; pretend that these are my narrowest options.
18 syls
checking: Bruce might purr loudly, softly, or not at all; pretend that these alternatives are a rich partition.
19 syls
checking: (Those simplifying pretences are of course very far from the truth.

21 syls
checking: That dependency hypothesis says that the lack of purring is outside my influence, it is causally independent of what I do.
19 syls
checking: Altogether there are twenty-seven dependency hypotheses expressible in this way, though some of them get very little credence.
18 syls
checking: Note that it is the pattern of counterfactuals, not any single one of them, that expresses causal dependence or independence.
error
checking: As we have seen, the same counterfactual I leave Bruce alone → he doesn't purr figures in the first hypothesis as part of a pattern of dependence and in the second as part of a pattern of independence.
error
checking: It is clear that not just any counterfactual could be part of a pattern expressing causal dependence or independence.
error
checking: The antecedent and consequent must specify occurrences capable of causing and being caused, and the occurrences must be entirely distinct.
20 syls
checking: Further, we must exclude "back-tracking counterfactuals" based on reasoning from different supposed effects back to different causes and forward again to differences in other effects.
error
checking: Suppose I am convinced that stroking has no influence over purring, but that I wouldn't stroke Bruce unless I were in a mood that gets him to purr softly by emotional telepathy.
18 syls
checking: Then I give credence to I stroke Bruce → he purrs softly taken in a back-tracking sense, but not taken in the sense that it must have if it is to be part of a pattern of causal dependence or independence.
18 syls
checking: Let us define causal counterfactuals as those that can belong to patterns of causal dependence or independence.
error
checking: Some will doubt that causal counterfactuals can be distinguished from others except in causal terms; I disagree, and think it possible to delimit the causal counterfactuals in other terms and thus provide noncircular counterfactual end p.326  analyses of causal dependence and causation itself.
error
checking: But that is a question for other papers.
11 syls
checking: 16 For present purposes, it is enough that dependency hypotheses can be expressed (sometimes, at least) by patterns of causal counterfactuals.
error
checking: I hope that much is adequately confirmed by examples like the one just considered.
18 syls
checking: And that much can be true regardless of whether the pattern of counterfactuals provides a noncircular analysis.
error
checking: Turning from language to propositions, what we want are causal counterfactuals A → S, where A is one of the agent's options and S belongs to some rich partition.
error
checking: The rich partition must be one whose members specify combinations of occurrences wholly distinct from the actions specified by the agent's options.
18 syls
checking: It seems a safe assumption that some such rich partition exists.
16 syls
checking: Suppose some definite one to be chosen (it should make no difference which one).
18 syls
checking: Define a full pattern as a set consisting of exactly one such counterfactual proposition for each option.
18 syls
checking: I claim that the conjunction of the counterfactuals in any full pattern is a dependency hypothesis.
error
checking: Conjunctions of different full patterns are contraries, as any two dependency hypotheses should be.
error
checking: For if S and S′ are contraries, and A is possible (which any option is), then also A → S and A → S′ are contraries;17 and any two full patterns must differ by at least one such contrary pair.
error
checking: What is not so clear is that some full pattern or other holds at any world, leaving no room for any other dependency hypotheses besides the conjunctions of full patterns.
18 syls
checking: We shall consider this question soon.
9 syls
checking: But for now, let us answer it by fiat.
11 syls
checking: Assume that there is a full pattern for every world, so that the dependency hypotheses are all and only the conjunctions of full patterns.
21 syls
checking: That assumption yields the causal decision theory proposed by Allan Gibbard and William Harper, op.
18 syls
checking: cit.
error
checking: , following a suggestion of Robert Stalnaker.
13 syls
checking: My statement of it amounts to their Savage-style formulation with conjunctions of full patterns of counterfactuals as act-independent states; and their discussion of consequences in their Section 6 shows that they join me in regarding these conjunctions as expressing causal dependence or independence.
20 syls
checking: Although they do not end p.327 explicitly distinguish causal counterfactuals from others, their Section 2 sketches a theory of counterfactuals which plainly is built to exclude back-trackers in any ordinary situation.
error
checking: This is essential to their purpose.
9 syls
checking: A theory which used counterfactuals in formally the same way, but which freely admitted back-trackers, would not be a causal decision theory.
error
checking: Its conjunctions of full patterns including back-trackers would not be causal dependency hypotheses, and it would give just those wrong answers about Newcomb problems that we causal decision theorists are trying to avoid.
19 syls
checking: 18 Consider some particular A and S. If a dependency hypothesis K is the conjunction of a full pattern that includes A → S, then AK implies S and C(S/AK) equals one.
error
checking: If K is the conjunction of a full pattern that includes not A → S but some contrary A → S′, then AK contradicts S and C(S/AK) equals zero.
18 syls
checking: Ex hypothesi, every dependency hypothesis K is of one kind or the other.
error
checking: Then the K's for which C(S/AK) equals one comprise a partition of A → S, while C(S/AK) equals zero for all other K's.
error
checking: It follows by the Rule of Additivity for credence that (12) C(A □→ S) = ∑K C(K)C(S/AK).
error
checking: (Comparing (12) with (8), we find that our present assumptions equate C(A → S) with C A (S), the credence of S imaged on the option A.) Substituting (12) into (7) we have (13) U(A) = ∑S C(A □→ S)V(AS), which amounts to Gibbard and Harper's defining formula for the "genuine expected utility" they deem it rational to maximise.
error
checking: 19 We have come the long way around to (13), which is not only simple but also intuitive in its own right.
error
checking: But (13) by itself does not display the causal character of Gibbard and Harper's theory, and that is what makes it worthwhile to come at it by way of dependency hypotheses.
error
checking: No single C(A → S) reveals the agent's causal views, since it sums the credences of hypotheses which set A → S in a pattern of dependence and others which set A → S in a pattern of independence.
18 syls
checking: Consequently end p.328  the roundabout approach helps us to appreciate what the theory of Gibbard and Harper has in common with that of someone like Skyrms who is reluctant to use counterfactuals in expressing dependency hypotheses.

error
checking: Counterfactual Dependence With Chancy Outcomes The assumption that there is a full pattern for each world is a consequence of Stalnaker's principle of Conditional Excluded Middle,20 which says that either X → Y or X → −Y holds at any world (where −Y is the negation of Y).

18 syls
checking: Hence so is the decision theory of Gibbard and Harper, insofar as it relies on Conditional Excluded Middle to support the assumption that there is a full pattern for each world.
18 syls
checking: Gibbard and Harper themselves are not to be faulted, for they tell us that their "reason for casting the rough theory in a form which gives these principles is that circumstances where these can fail involve complications which it would be best to ignore in preliminary work".

error

18 syls
checking: It says that the way things would be on a false but possible supposition X is no less specific than the way things actually are.

19 syls
checking: The less specific the supposition, the less it settles; the more farfetched it is, the less can be settled by what carries over from actuality; end p.329 and the less is settled otherwise, the more must be settled arbitrarily or not at all.
19 syls
checking: But the supposition that an agent realises one of his narrowest options is neither unspecific nor far-fetched.
error
checking: So the Arbitrariness Objection may be formidable against the general principle of Conditional Excluded Middle, yet not formidable against the special case of it that gives us a full pattern for each world.
18 syls
checking: Further, Bas van Fraassen has taught us a general method for tolerating arbitrariness.
error
checking: 21 When forced to concede that certain choices would be arbitrary, we leave those choices unmade and we ask what happens on all the alternative ways of making them.
error
checking: What is constant over all the ways of making them is determinate, what varies is indeterminate.
18 syls
checking: If the provision of full patterns for certain worlds is partly arbitrary, so be it.
20 syls
checking: Then indeed some arbitrary variation may infect the C(K)'s, C(S/AK)'s, C(A → S)'s, and even the U(A)'s.
18 syls
checking: It might even infect the set of U-maximal options.
15 syls
checking: Then indeed it would be (wholly or partly) indeterminate which options the GibbardHarper theory commends as rational.
19 syls
checking: All of that might happen, but it needn't.
error
checking: The arbitrary variation might vanish part way through the calculation, leaving the rest determinate.
20 syls
checking: The less arbitrary variation there is at the start, of course, the less risk that there will be any at the end.
18 syls
checking: I conclude that the Arbitrariness Objection by itself is no great threat to Gibbard and Harper's version of causal decision theory.
18 syls
checking: We can well afford to admit that the theory might fail occasionally to give a determinate answer.
19 syls
checking: Indeed, I admit that already, for any version, on other grounds.
18 syls
checking: I think there is sometimes an arbitrary element in the assignment of C and V functions to partly rational agents.
19 syls
checking: No worries, so long as we can reasonably hope that the answers are mostly determinate.
18 syls
checking: Unfortunately there is a second, and worse, objection against Conditional Excluded Middle and the Gibbard-Harper theory.
21 syls
checking: In part it is an independent objection; in part an argument that van Fraassen's method of tolerating arbitrariness would be severely overloaded if we insisted on providing full patterns all around (and a fortiori if we insisted on saving Conditional Excluded  Middle generally), and we could not reasonably hope that the answers are mostly determinate.
18 syls
checking: Suppose the agent thinks—as he should if he is well-educated—that the end p.330 actual world may very well be an indeterministic one, where many things he cares about are settled by chance processes.
18 syls
checking: Then he may give little of his credence to worlds where full patterns hold.
17 syls
added: Then he may give little of his credence to worlds where full patterns hold.
checking: In fact he may well give little credence to any of the A → S counterfactuals that make up these patterns.
error
checking: Consider again my problem of getting Bruce to purr.
14 syls
checking: I think that Bruce works by firing of neurons, I think neurons work by chemical reactions, and I think the making or breaking of a chemical bond is a chance event in the same way that the radioactive decay of a nucleus is.
20 syls
checking: Maybe I still give some small credence to the twenty-seven full patterns considered in Section 9—after all, I might be wrong to think that Bruce is chancy.
18 syls
checking: But mostly I give my credence to the denials of all the counterfactuals that appear in those patterns, and to such counterfactuals as I brush Bruce → a chance process goes on in him which has certain probabilities of eventuating in his purring loudly, softly, or not at all; and likewise for the options of stroking and leaving alone.
error
checking: A diehard supporter of the Gibbard-Harper theory (not Gibbard or Harper, I should think) might claim that I give my credence mostly to worlds where it is arbitrary which one of the twenty-seven full patterns holds, but determinate that some one of them holds.
18 syls
checking: If he is right, even this easy little decision problem comes out totally indeterminate, for the arbitrary variation he posits is surely enough to swing the answer any way at all.
18 syls
checking: Nor would it help if I believe that whichever I did, all the probabilities of Bruce's purring loudly, softly, or not at all would be close to zero or one.
21 syls
checking: Nor would a more realistic decision problem fare any better: unless the agent is a fairly convinced determinist, the answers we want vanish into indeterminacy.
18 syls
checking: The diehard destroys the theory in order to save it.
14 syls
checking: Anyway, the diehard is just wrong.
9 syls
checking: If the world is the chancy way I mostly think it is, there's nothing at all arbitrary or indeterminate about the counterfactuals in the full patterns.
18 syls
checking: They are flatly, determinately false.
error
checking: So is their disjunction; the diehard agrees that it is determinate in truth value, but the trouble is that he thinks it is determinately true.
error
checking: Unlike the Arbitrariness Objection, the Chance Objection seems to me decisive both against Conditional Excluded Middle generally and against the assumption that there is a full pattern for each world.
18 syls
checking: Our conception of dependency hypotheses as conjunctions of full patterns is too narrow.
18 syls
checking: Fortunately, the needed correction is not far to seek.
15 syls
checking: end p.331 I shall have to assume that anyone who gives credence to indeterministic worlds without full patterns is someone who—implicitly and in practice, if not according to his official philosophy—distributes his credence over contingent propositions about single-case, objective chances.
error
checking: Chance is a kind of probability that is neither frequency nor credence, though related to both.
18 syls
checking: I have no analysis to offer, but I am convinced that we do have this concept and we don't have any substitute for it.
18 syls
checking: 22 Suppose some rich partition to be chosen which meets the requirement of distinct occurrences laid down in Section 9.
error
checking: Let the variable p range over candidate probability distributions for this rich partition: functions assigning to each S in the partition a number p(S) in the interval from zero to one, such that the p(S)'s sum to one.
18 syls
checking: Let [P=p] be the proposition that holds at just those worlds where the chances of the S's, as of the time when the agent realises his chosen option, are correctly given by the function p. Call [P=p] a chance proposition, and note that the chance propositions are a partition.
19 syls
checking: Now consider the causal counterfactuals A → [P=p] from the agent's options to the chance propositions.
error
checking: Define a probabilistic full pattern as a set containing exactly one such counterfactual for each option.
error
checking: I claim that the conjunction of the counterfactuals in any probabilistic full pattern is a causal dependency hypothesis.
error
checking: It specifies plain causal dependence or independence of the chances of the S's on the A's, and thereby it specifies a probabilistic kind of causal dependence of the S's themselves on the A's.
19 syls
checking: Here, for example, are verbal expressions of three chance propositions.
18 syls
checking: [P=p 1 ] The chance that Bruce purrs loudly is 50%; the chance that he purrs softly is 40%; and the chance that he purrs not at all is 10%.
error
checking: [P=p 2 ] (similar, but with 30%, 50%, 20%).
error
checking: [P=p 3 ] (similar, but with 10%, 10%, 80%).
error
checking: (The chance is to be at the time of my realising an option; the purring or not is to be at a certain time shortly after.
error
checking: ) And here is a dependency hypothesis that might get as much of my credence as any: end p.332 I brush Bruce → [P=p 1 ] holds; I stroke Bruce → [P=p 2 ] holds; I leave Bruce alone → [P=p 3 ] holds.
18 syls
checking: Observe that this hypothesis addresses itself not only to the question of whether loud and soft purring are within my influence, but also to the question of the extent and the direction of my influence.
18 syls
checking: If a chance proposition says that one of the S's has a chance of one, it must say that the others all have chances of zero.
18 syls
checking: Call such a chance proposition extreme.
10 syls
checking: I shall not distinguish between an extreme proposition and the S that it favours.
18 syls
checking: If they differ, it is only on worlds where something with zero chance nevertheless happens.
21 syls
checking: I am inclined to think that they do not differ at all, since there are no worlds where anything with zero chance happens; the contrary opinion comes of mistaking infinitesimals for zero.
18 syls
checking: But even if there is a difference between extreme chance propositions and their favoured S's, it will not matter to calculations of utility so let us neglect it.
19 syls
checking: Then our previous dependency hypotheses, the conjunctions of full patterns, are subsumed under the conjunctions of probabilistic full patterns.
18 syls
checking: So are the conjunctions of mixed full patterns that consist partly of A → S's and partly of A → [P=p]'s.
18 syls
checking: Dare we assume that there is a probabilistic full pattern for every world, so that on this second try we have succeeded in capturing all the dependency hypotheses by means of counterfactuals?
error
checking: I shall assume it, not without misgivings.
11 syls
checking: That means accepting a special case of Conditional Excluded Middle, but (i) the Chance Objection will not arise again,23 (ii) there should not be too much need for arbitrary choice on other grounds, since the options are quite specific suppositions and not far-fetched, and (iii) limited arbitrary choice results in nothing worse than a limited risk of the answers going indeterminate.
19 syls
checking: So my own causal decision theory consists of two theses.
16 syls
checking: My main thesis is that we should maximise expected utility calculated by means of dependency hypotheses.
error
checking: It is this main thesis that I claim is implicitly accepted also by Gibbard and Harper, Skyrms, and Sobel.
19 syls
checking: My subsidiary thesis, which I put forward much more tentatively and which I won't try to foist on my allies, is that the dependency hypotheses are exactly the conjunctions of probabilistic full patterns.
19 syls
checking: (The change I have made in the Gibbard-Harper version has been end p.333 simply to replace the rich partition of S's by the partition of chance propositions [P=p] pertaining to these S's.
error
checking: One might think that perhaps that was no change at all: perhaps the S's already were the chance propositions for some other rich partition.
20 syls
checking: However, I think it at least doubtful that the chance propositions can be said to "specify combinations of occurrences" as the S's were required to do.
18 syls
checking: This question would lead us back to the neo-Humean thesis discussed in Section 8.
error
checking: ) Consider some particular A and S. If a dependency hypothesis K is the conjunction of a probabilistic full pattern, then for some p, K implies A → [P=p].
21 syls
checking: Then AK implies [P=p]; and C(S/AK) equals p(S), at least in any ordinary case.
error
checking: 24 For any p, the K's that are conjunctions of probabilistic full patterns including A → [P=p] are a partition of A → [P=p].
error
checking: So we have (14)∑p C(A □→ [P = p])p(S) = ∑K C(K)C(S/AK).
error
checking: Substituting (14) into (7) gives us a formula defining expected utility in terms of counterfactuals with chance propositions as consequents.
error
checking: (15) U(A) = ∑S ∑p C(A □→ [P = p])p(S)V(AS).
error
checking: For any S and any number q from zero to one, let [P(S)=q] be the proposition that holds at just those worlds where the chance of S, at the time when the agent realises his option, is q. It is the disjunction of those [P=p]'s for which p(S) equals q. We can lump together counter-factuals in (14) and (15) to obtain reformulations in which the consequents concern chances of single S's: (16) ∑q C(A □→ [P(S) = q])q = ∑KC(K)C(S/AK), (17) U(A) = ∑S ∑q C(A □→ [P(S) = q])qV(AS).
18 syls
checking: There are various ways to mix probabilities and counterfactuals.
error
checking: I have argued that when things are chancy, it isn't good enough to take credences of plain A → S counterfactuals.
error
checking: The counterfactuals themselves must be made probabilistic.
error
checking: I have made them so by giving them chance propositions as consequents.
error
checking: Sobel makes them so in a different way: as we noted in Section 7, he puts the probability in the connective.
18 syls
checking: end p.334 Under our present assumptions (and setting aside extraordinary worlds where the common asymmetries of time break down), the two approaches are equivalent.
error
checking: Sobel's quantitative counterfactual with a plain consequent If it were that A, it would be with probability q that S holds at W iff W A (S) equals q. Given my derivation of the imaging function from the dependency hypotheses, that is so iff C(S/AK W ) equals q. That is so (setting aside the extraordinary worlds) iff K W implies A □→ [P(S) = q].
error
checking: Given that there is a probabilistic full pattern for each world, that is so iff A □→ [P(S) = q] holds at W. Hence the Sobel quantitative counterfactual with a plain consequent is the same proposition as the corresponding plain counterfactual with a chance consequent.
error
checking: If ever we must retract the assumption that there is a probabilistic full pattern for each world (or if we want to take the extra-ordinary worlds into account), the two approaches will separate and we may need to choose; but let us cross that bridge if we come to it.

checking: The Hunter-Richter Problem That concludes an exposition and survey of causal decision theory.
18 syls
checking: In this final section, I wish to defend it against an objection raised by Daniel Hunter and Reed Richter.
18 syls
checking: 25 Their target is the Gibbard-Harper version; but it depends on nothing that is special to that version, so I shall restate it as an objection against causal decision theory generally.
error
checking: Suppose you are one player in a two-person game.
13 syls
checking: Each player can play red, play white, play blue, or not play.
13 syls
checking: If both play the same colour, each gets a thousand dollars; if they play different colours, each loses a thousand dollars; if one or both don't play, the game is off and no money changes hands.
error
checking: Value goes by money; the game is played only once; there is no communication or prearrangement between the players; and there is nothing to give a hint in favour of one colour or another—no "Whites rule OK"!
21 syls
checking: sign placed where both can see that both can see it, or the like.
14 syls
checking: So far, this game seems not worthwhile.
8 syls
checking: But you have been persuaded that you and the other player are very much alike psychologically and hence very likely to choose alike, so that you are much more likely to play and win than to play and lose.
18 syls
checking: Is it rational for you to play?
9 syls
added:  So far, this game seems not worthwhile. Is it rational for you to play?
checking: end p.335 Yes.
error
checking: So say I, so say Hunter and Richter, and so (for what it is worth) says noncausal decision theory.
18 syls
checking: But causal decision theory seems to say that it is not rational to play.
18 syls
checking: If it says that, it is wrong and stands refuted.
12 syls
checking: It seems that you have four dependency hypotheses to consider, corresponding to the four ways your partner might play: K 1 Whatever you do, he would play red; K 2 Whatever you do, he would play white; K 3 Whatever you do, he would play blue; K 4 Whatever you do, he would not play.
18 syls
checking: By the symmetry of the situation, K 1 and K 2 and K 3 should get equal credence.
error
checking: Then the expected utility of not playing is zero, whereas the expected utilities of playing the three colours are  equal and negative.
18 syls
checking: So we seem to reach the unwelcome conclusion that not playing is your Umaximal option.
18 syls
checking: I reply that Hunter and Richter have gone wrong by misrepresenting your partition of options.
18 syls
checking: Imagine that you have a servant.
9 syls
checking: You can play red, white, or blue; you can not play; or you can tell your servant to play for you.
18 syls
checking: The fifth option, delegating the choice, might be the one that beats not playing and makes it rational to play.
19 syls
checking: Given the servant, each of our previous dependency hypotheses splits in three.
20 syls
checking: For instance K 1 splits into: K 1,1 Whatever you do, your partner would play red, and your servant would play red if you delegated the choice; K 1,2 Whatever you do, your partner would play red, and your servant would play white if you delegated the choice; K 1,3 Whatever you do, your partner would play red, and your servant would play blue if you delegated the choice.
error
checking: (If you and your partner are much alike, he too has a servant, so we can split further by dividing the case in which he plays red, for instance, into the case in which he plays red for himself and the case in which he delegates his choice and his servant plays red for him.
18 syls
checking: However, that difference doesn't matter to you and is outside your influence, so let us disregard it.
error
checking: ) The information that you and your partner (and your respective servants) are much alike might persuade you to give little credence to the dependency hypotheses K 1,2 and K 1,3 but to give more to K 1,1 ; and likewise for the subdivisions of K 2 and K 3 .
18 syls
checking: Then you give your credence mostly to dependency hypotheses according to which you would either win or break even by delegating your choice.
20 syls
checking: Then end p.336 causal decision theory does not tell you, wrongly, that it is rational not to play.
error
checking: Playing by delegating your choice is your U-maximal option.
17 syls
added: Playing by delegating your choice is your U-maximal option.
checking: But you don't have a servant.
8 syls
checking: What of it?
3 syls
checking: You must have a tie-breaking procedure.
10 syls
checking: There must be something or other that you do after deliberation that ends in a tie.
18 syls
checking: Delegating your choice to your tie-breaking procedure is a fifth option for you, just as delegating it to your servant would be if you had one.
19 syls
checking: If you are persuaded that you will probably win if you play because you and your partner are alike psychologically, it must be because you are persuaded that your tie-breaking procedures are alike.
18 syls
checking: You could scarcely think that the two of you are likely to coordinate without resorting to your tie-breaking procedures, since ex hypothesi the situation plainly is a tie!
18 syls
checking: So you have a fifth option, and as the story is told, it has greater expected utility than not playing.
18 syls
checking: This is not the option of playing red, or white, or blue, straightway at the end of deliberation, although if you choose it you will indeed end up playing red or white or blue.
error
checking: What makes it a different option is that it interposes something extra—something other than deliberation—after you are done deliberating and before you play.

checking: 26 Postscript to "Causal Decision Theory" Reply to Rabinowicz In a recent article, Wlodzimierz Rabinowicz carries the comparison between my theory and Sobel's farther than I had done.
error
checking: 1 He also end p.337 advances two criticisms against my discussion.
error
checking: One uncovers a clear mistake on my part, but the other rests on a misunderstanding.
18 syls
checking: First the mistake.
4 syls
checking: Suppose we start, as Sobel does, with the imaging function—in Sobel's terminology, the tendencies of worlds—and we take equivalence classes under the relation of imaging alike.
18 syls
checking: Call these classes tendency propositions.
11 syls
checking: I suggested that these should turn out to be the same as my dependency hypotheses.
19 syls
checking: Rabinowicz rightly objects (p.
error
checking: 311).
error
checking: Distinguo: let a practical dependency hypothesis be a maximally specific proposition about how the things the  agent cares about do and do not depend causally on his present actions; let a full dependency hypothesis be a maximally specific proposition about how all things whatever do and do not depend causally on the agent's present actions.
error
checking: By my definition, a "dependency hypothesis" is a practical dependency hypothesis; whereas a tendency proposition is, if anything, not a practical but a full dependency hypothesis.
20 syls
checking: Luckily my mistake does not damage my discussion, since it would have made no difference if I had worked in terms of full rather than practical dependency hypotheses throughout.
18 syls
checking: Next the misunderstanding.
7 syls
checking: I had presupposed (1) that any option would be compatible with any dependency hypothesis; I had also supposed (2) that at least sometimes, an image of a world on a proposition would be "blurred", dividing its probability over several worlds.
error
checking: My discussion of counterfactuals elsewhere indicated that I also accept (3) an assumption of "centering".
error
processed: 6500
checking: But Rabinowicz shows that (1), (2), and (3) are inconsistent (Theorem 1, p. 313).
error
checking: This looks like trouble for me.
7 syls
checking: Not so—distinguo again: (3A) Centering of the imaging function is the thesis that whenever a proposition A holds at a world W, the image of W on A is the distribution that puts all its probability on world W. (3B) Centering of counterfactuals is the thesis that whenever a proposition A holds at a world W, a "would" counterfactual with antecedent A holds at W iff its consequent does.
error
checking: What Rabinowicz shows is that (1), (2) and (3A) are inconsistent.
error
checking: What my discussion of counterfactuals indicates is that I accept (3B).
error
checking: I do indeed.
4 syls
checking: But I reject (3A); therefore, Rabinowicz's difficulties for decision theory with a centered imaging function are no threat to me.
error
checking: Sobel discusses counterfactuals and decision theory together, using the same apparatus of imaging (or "tendency") functions.
error
checking: His theory of counterfactuals says that a "would" counterfactual with antecedent end p.338 A holds at a world W iff its consequent holds at every world to which the image of W on A assigns positive probability.
error
checking: That means that for Sobel, centering of the imaging function and of counterfactuals are equivalent.
18 syls
checking: Not so for me.
4 syls
checking: I might have done well to warn the reader that I disagree with Sobel on this point, though strictly speaking a disagreement about counterfactuals is irrelevant to the comparison of our decision theories.
18 syls
checking: Example.
3 syls
checking: A coin is about to be tossed (proposition A).
13 syls
checking: The coin will be tossed fairly, with equal chance of heads and tails.
15 syls
checking: It will in fact fall heads.
6 syls
checking: Then I say that the image of our world on A is blurred, not centered: it distributes probability equally between heads-worlds (among them ours) and tails-worlds.
18 syls
checking: But I also say, by centering of counterfactuals, that if it were that A—as is in fact the case—then the coin would fall heads.
error
checking: Contra Sobel's theory, this counterfactual holds although its consequent does not hold at all worlds to which the image assigns positive probability.
error
checking: (I don't deny that if it were that A, then there would be some chance that the coin would fall tails.
18 syls
checking: For this too follows from centering of counterfactuals.
error
checking: There would be some chance of it; but it would not happen.
13 syls
checking: I say that the counterfactuals about outcomes and the counterfactuals about chances are compatible.
error
checking: For further discussion, see Postscript D to "Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow," in this volume.
error
checking: ) end p.339 1 Twenty-Eight Utilitarianism and Truthfulness A demon has seized two highly rational act-utilitarians—call them "You" and "I"—and put them in separate rooms.
error
checking: In each room there are two buttons, a red one and a green one.
15 syls
checking: The demon has arranged that by both pushing our red buttons or by both pushing our green buttons we bring about the Good; but by pushing one red button and one green button (or by pushing both buttons or neither button in one of the rooms) we bring about the Bad.
18 syls
checking: The demon has made sure that we both know all the facts I have listed so far, that we both know that we both know them, and so on.
18 syls
checking: You manage to send me a message, and the message is "I pushed red".
17 syls
added: You manage to send me a message, and the message is "I pushed red".
checking: But, strange to say, that does not help.
8 syls
checking: For I reason as follows.
7 syls
checking: "You are a highly rational utilitarian.
14 syls
checking: You act in whatever way you think will have the best consequences, with no regard to any other consideration.
18 syls
checking: This goes for sending messages: you send whatever message you think will have the best consequences, caring not at all about truthfulness for its own sake.
18 syls
checking: So I have not the slightest reason to believe your message unless I have reason to believe that you think truthfulness will have the best consequences.
18 syls
checking: In this case, you must know that truthfulness has the best consequences only if I have some end p.340 reason to believe you and to act accordingly.
19 syls
checking: If not, there is nothing to choose between the expected consequences of truth and untruth, so you have no reason whatever to choose truth rather than untruth.
18 syls
checking: I have not the slightest reason to believe you unless I have reason to believe that you think that I have reason to believe you.
18 syls
checking: But I know that you—knowledgeable and rational creature that you are—will not think that I have reason to believe you unless I really do have.
18 syls
checking: Do I?
2 syls
checking: I cannot show that I have reason to believe you without first assuming what is to be shown: that I have reason to believe you.
19 syls
checking: So I cannot, without committing the fallacy of petitio principii, show that I have reason to believe you.
error
checking: Therefore I do not.
5 syls
checking: Your message gives me not the slightest reason to believe that you pushed red, and not the slightest reason to push red myself".
18 syls
checking: Arguing thus, I push at random.
9 syls
checking: By chance I push green.
5 syls
checking: Such is the disutility of utilitarianism, according to D. H. Hodgson.
error
checking: 2 We might better say: such is the disutility of expecting utilitarianism, and it is not sufficiently compensated by the efforts to maximize utility that fulfil the expectation.
error
checking: Hodgson says that knowledgeable and rational act-utilitarians would have no reason to expect one another to be truthful, not even when the combination of truthfulness with expectation of truthfulness would have good consequences; so they would forfeit the benefits of communication.
error
checking: Similarly they would forfeit the benefits of promising; for an example of this, just change the message in my example to "I will push red".
18 syls
checking: More generally, it seems that Hodgson's utilitarians would forfeit the benefits of all the conventions whereby we coordinate our actions to serve our common interests.
error
checking: The conventions of truthfulness and of promise-keeping are but two of these.
18 syls
checking: But to talk myself into ignoring your message "I pushed red" is absurd.
19 syls
checking: My example has no special features; it is just a simple and stark instance of the general situation Hodgson says would prevail among knowledgeable and rational act-utilitarians.
18 syls
checking: I conclude that Hodgson is wrong in general.
12 syls
checking: Where, then, is the flaw in my Hodgsonian argument that I ought to ignore your message?
error
checking: Every step up to the italicised one seems true, and every step beyond that seems false.
error
checking: I think the argument went wrong when I tacitly assumed that I could not have reason to believe you unless I could show, using nothing but the facts set forth in the first paragraph—our situation, our utilitarianism and rationality, our knowledge of these, our knowledge end p.341 of one another's knowledge of these, and so on—that I did have reason to believe you.
18 syls
checking: But why must my premises be limited to these?
13 syls
checking: I should not use any premise that is inconsistent with the facts of the first paragraph; but there is nothing wrong with using a premise that is independent of these facts, if such a premise is available.
18 syls
checking: The premise that you will be truthful (whenever it is best to instill in me true beliefs about matters you have knowledge of, as in this case) is just such a premise.
18 syls
checking: It is available to me.
8 syls
checking: At least, common sense suggests that it would be; and our only reason to suppose that it would not is the Hodgsonian argument we are now disputing.
18 syls
checking: It is independent of the facts listed in the first paragraph.
17 syls
added: It is independent of the facts listed in the first paragraph.
checking: On the one hand, it is consistent with our rationality and utilitarianism, our knowledge thereof, and so on.
18 syls
checking: For if you are truthful (except when it is best that I should have false beliefs), and if I expect you to be, and if you expect me to expect you to be, and so on, then you will have a good utilitarian reason to be truthful.
19 syls
checking: You will be truthful without compromising your utilitarianism and without adding to your utilitarianism an independent maxim of truthfulness.
error
checking: On the other hand, it is not implied by our rationality and utilitarianism, our knowledge thereof, and so on.
18 syls
checking: For if you  are systematically untruthful (expect when it is best that I should have false beliefs), and if I expect you to be, and if you expect me to expect you to be, and so on, then you will have a good utilitarian reason to be untruthful.
18 syls
checking: I am speaking, of course, of truthfulness and untruthfulness in English; I should mention that systematic untruthfulness in English is the same thing as systematic truthfulness in a different language anti-English, exactly like English in syntax but exactly opposite in truth conditions.
error
checking: Therefore I should have decided that I did have reason to believe your message and to push red myself.
18 syls
checking: This reason is admittedly not premised merely on our situation, our rationality and utilitarianism, our knowledge of these, and so on.
20 syls
checking: But it is premised on further knowledge that I do in fact possess, and that is perfectly consistent with these facts.

18 syls
checking: I claim to resolve the opposition thus: Call two visual experiences modification-equivalent if they are connected by a chain of actual or possible visual experiences such that, given any two adjacent members of the chain, one can pass from one to the other with change of percept but no percept of change.
21 syls
checking: We often ignore differences between modification-equivalent visual experiences.
20 syls
checking: Some visual experience, at least, consists of a percept of a colormosaic; it is plausible that any visual experience is modification-equivalent to experiences of some end p.343 definite color-mosaic.
18 syls

checking: Such adverbs as "always," "sometimes," "never," "usually," "often," and "seldom" are quantifiers; but often, contrary to first impression, they do not quantify over moments of time.
19 syls
checking: They can be seen as unselective quantifiers, binding all variables in their scopes.
error
checking: Various sentences, including some notorious puzzlers, can be seen as transformed versions of sentences formed using adverbs of quantification with restrictive "if"-clauses.

error
checking: I show how to incorporate this semantic analysis into the description of a language game of commanding and end p.350 permitting.
18 syls
checking: The crucial rule of the game stipulates that the permissibility of possible worlds shall change when commands and permissions are given, in such a way that any imperative or permissive sentence uttered by someone in authority shall be true under Chellas's semantics.
error
checking: A precise formulation of this rule is easy in the case of commands; the case of permissions, however, is problematic.

2 syls
checking: Lucas insists on the dialectical character of his Gödelian refutation of mechanism.
error
checking: This means that his arithmetical output depends on the mechanistic accusation he is out to refute.
error
checking: Then if he is a machine, he is one that responds to input.
16 syls
checking: But if he is such a machine, there is no reason to think that his arithmetical output (when responding to a mechanistic accusation in the way he intends to) is true or consistent, hence no reason to doubt that it might contain a false sentence expressing its own consistency.

2 syls
checking: A context is a location—time, place, world—in which a sentence end p.351 may be said; an index is an n-tuple of features of context that can vary independently.
18 syls
checking: I argue that semantics of natural language must involve both context-dependence and index-dependence; neither can replace the other.
19 syls

error
checking: It demonstrates that if, as we usually suppose, we achieve more-or-less determinate reference, that must be so in virtue of constraints not established by our own stipulation—perhaps, as Merrill has suggested, constraints based on an objective discrimination between things and classes which are more and less eligible to serve as referents.

error
checking: Abstract.
2 syls
checking: We ought to believe in other possible worlds and individuals because systematic philosophy goes more smoothly in many ways if we do; the reason parallels the mathematicians' reason for believing in the set-theoretical universe.
18 syls
checking: By "other worlds" I mean other things of a kind with the world we are part of: concrete particulars, unified by spatiotemporal unification or something analogous, sufficient in number and variety to satisfy a principle to the effect, roughly, that anything can coexist with anything.
18 syls
checking: I answer objections claiming that such modal realism is trivially inconsistent, or leads to paradoxes akin to those of naive set theory, or undermines the possibility of modal knowledge, or leads to scepticism or indifference or a loss of the seeming arbitrariness of things.
error
checking: But I concede that its extreme disagreement with common opinion is a high price to pay for its advantages.
18 syls
checking: I therefore consider various versions of ersatz model realism, in which abstract representations are supposed to replace the other worlds; different versions suffer from different objections, and none is satisfactory.
19 syls
checking: Finally, I consider the so-called problem of trans-world end p.354 identity.
error
checking: I stress a distinction between the uncontroversial thesis that things exist according to many worlds and the very problematic thesis that things exist as part of many worlds.

2 syls
checking: A structural universal is one such that, necessarily, any instance of it consists of proper parts that instantiate certain simpler universals in a certain pattern.
19 syls
checking: Forrest has suggested that structural universals could serve as ersatz possible worlds; Armstrong has offered several reasons why a theory of universals must accept them.
error
checking: I distinguish three conceptions of what a structural universal is, and I raise objections against structural universals under all three conceptions.
18 syls
checking: I then consider whether uninstantiated structural universals, which are required by Forrest's proposal, are more problematic than instantiated ones.

checking: Abstract.
2 syls
checking: Armstrong and Forrest observe that my case against structural universals has equal force against "structures" composed of universals plus particular instances thereof.
error
checking: To this I say that the friend of universals might get by without the structures.
error
checking: Whether he can depends on what work he wants his theory to do, in particular on whether he wants it to provide truthmaking entities for all truths.

I think not; so I

**********************************
We conclude that if
  Jim asked Jack for help today,
Jack would not help him.
**********************************
Different cases
  come out differently, and I
would like to know why.
**********************************
It came instead from
  an asymmetry in the
range of candidates.
**********************************
What reason have I,
  then, to regard him as one
person and not two?
**********************************
So Tim cannot kill
  Grandfather. Why not? For some
commonplace reason.
**********************************
No Grandfather, no
  Father; no Father, no Tim;
no Tim, no killing.
**********************************
Neither can replace
  the other.) Chance of credence
need not detain us.
**********************************
All this is just as
  it would be for laws about
other magnitudes.
**********************************
Let t be a time
  at which there was some chance that
H would come about.
**********************************
Certainly this is
  weighty evidence, but it
is not decisive.
**********************************
Rather it must work
  by imaging. That is wrong.
Is there such a thing?
**********************************
But if this is a
  case of piecemeal causation,
we have no problem.
**********************************
Zero chance is no
  chance, and nothing with zero
chance ever happens.
**********************************
It would be strange to
  single out my act as the
cause of all those deaths.

Not that the causal
  chain must be short. You can kill
by delayed action.

—that an event could
  have been postponed and could have
happened differently.
**********************************
Thus I say that c
  is a cause of e if there
is a sequence c,.

So we might extend
  the analysis. Without
them, all would be well.
**********************************
An event depends
  on others, which depend in
turn on yet others,.

Why did I fly to

Are we of two minds?

We might want to know

Those assumptions are

not defend them here.
**********************************
That is not to say,
  not clearly, that it would not
have occurred at all.
**********************************
Therefore they are not
  eligible to stand in
causal dependence.
**********************************
The need is urgent
  also in connection with
causal preemption.
**********************************
Would those who belong

prepared to say it?
**********************************
For any scene just
  a little different would
have been a bad scene.

Or consider a

**********************************
Then I am able
  to break a promise. But there
is more to be said.
